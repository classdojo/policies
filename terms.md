# ClassDojo Terms of Service

Last updated: March 21, 2016

The following are the terms of service (“Terms of Service”) that define the relationship between Class Twist, Inc. (doing business as ClassDojo (“Company,” “ClassDojo,” “we,” or “us”)) and you, and govern your use of ClassDojo’s services.

We’ve done our best to write this policy in simple, clear terms. We’ve also added a column on the right that provides short explanations of the legal language in plain English (it starts with ‘Basically...’) to aid in understanding, but it isn’t legally binding.

## Agreeing to our Terms

Thank you for your interest in ClassDojo, which owns and operates the services offered on classdojo.com (“ClassDojo Website”) and any associated mobile applications (“ClassDojo Apps”) or products and services that Company may provide now or in the future (collectively, the “Service”). 

When using the Service, you will also be subject to the ClassDojo Privacy Policy and any posted guidelines, policies or rules applicable to specific features of the ClassDojo Site or ClassDojo App, which may be posted from time to time (collectively the “Guidelines”). These Terms of Service, including any other Guidelines and future modifications (collectively, the “Agreement”) govern your use of the Service and is a legal contract between you and ClassDojo. By registering for an account on, or otherwise accessing or using the ClassDojo Service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of an institution that has a separate written agreement with ClassDojo, that agreement governs your use of the Service. 

If you are under the age of 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Agreement. If you don’t get your parent or guardian to read and agree to the Agreement, you don’t have permission to use the Service. 

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms “you”, “your” or “Member” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the Service.

>By using or signing up for ClassDojo, you agree to these terms. Welcome to the community!

## Using the Service

As long as you are complying with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company gives you permission to access and use the Service that you select through the applicable registration process. The Service is available for your personal, noncommercial use.

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether, including, for example, if you do not comply with this Agreement or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. You can stop using our Service at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. We may also stop providing Service to you, or add or create new limits to our Service or restrict your access to all or a part of the Service at any time without notice or liability. Access to and use of the Service itself is free, but in the future, we may offer new or additional special features which ClassDojo may charge for. Please also be aware that while we currently provide our mobile services for free, your carrier’s normal rates and fees still apply, such as text messaging and data fees.

The right to access and use the Service is revoked in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited, if any.

>Basically,
>
>You can use ClassDojo, as long as you follow the rules in these terms.

## Your Information and Content

In the course of using the Service, you and other users may provide or post certain content or information which may be used by ClassDojo in connection with the Service and which may be visible to certain other users (“User Submissions”). Please visit our Privacy Policy for additional information on the types of information different types of users are able to provide. Additionally, some User Submissions may be deemed an Education Record (as defined below).
 
You retain all ownership rights you have in any User Submissions. ClassDojo does not claim any ownership rights in the User Submissions. 

In order to allow ClassDojo to provide the Service, you hereby grant to us a limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable (as necessary to perform the Service), worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable (only to a successor) right and license to (i) use, copy, store, distribute, publicly perform and display, modify, and create derivative works (such as changes we make so that your content works better with our Service) such User Submissions as necessary to provide, improve and make the Service available to you and other users, including through any future media in which the Service may be distributed, (ii) use and disclose metrics and analytics regarding the User Submissions in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in improving our service or in marketing and business development purposes), (iii) use any User Submission (including any Education Record) that has been de-identified for any product development, research or other purpose; and (iv) use for other purposes permitted by the ClassDojo Privacy Policy.

Company will only share and use your personally identifiable information in accordance with ClassDojo’s current Privacy Policy at http://www.classdojo.com/privacy. 

The license in (i) above will terminate when you delete any User Submissions with intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) (“IP content”)), you or your Institution (as defined below) deletes an Education Record, you delete any personal information, or you delete your account, unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. Note, however, that any User Submissions that may be in or related to messages sent through ClassDojo Messaging, Class Story, or School Story may be kept after you delete your account. Please see our deletion FAQs for more information. When you delete IP content, Education Records, or personal information, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer. However, you understand that any removed User Submission may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others). You are responsible for making sure that you have all rights in the User Submissions, including the rights necessary for you to grant us the foregoing licenses to the User Submissions. 

All information posted or transmitted through the Service is the responsibility of the person that posted it, and we will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content. ClassDojo cannot guarantee the identity of any other users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Service, or the authenticity of any data which users may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all content accessed by you using the Service is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. We do not guarantee that we will publish any of your User Submissions, and reserve the right to remove User Submissions from the Service at any time for any reason, such as if we receive a notice reports a User Submission infringes someone’s intellectual property rights.

Our automated systems analyze your User Submissions (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, and for spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored. ClassDojo will not analyze any Educational Records for the purpose of providing behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or parents. The foregoing shall not be construed to (i) prohibit ClassDojo from marketing or advertising directly to parents so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of Educational Records to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising or (ii) to limit the ability of ClassDojo to use Educational Records for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes.

We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about ClassDojo, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them.

>Basically,
>
>You own any content you post on ClassDojo. You also give us permission to use it to provide the ClassDojo service to you and other users. Our use of any personal information you submit is also subject to our Privacy Policy.

## Privacy

Your privacy is extremely important to us, and we take great care to limit what we collect and how we use it, and to enable you to understand our policies. Please read our Privacy Policy which explains how we treat your personal information and protect your privacy when you use our Service. By using our Service, you agree that ClassDojo can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

> Basically,

## Additional Terms by User Type

a. **Students**: if you are a student accessing the Service at the invitation of a teacher or other school official, the following terms apply to you.

	i. Only students who have been invited by their teacher, school, or district may use the Service. You may not access or use the Service unless you are invited by a teacher, school, or district who is authorized to give you access to the Service.

	ii. We request minimal personal information to be provided from students to enable use of the Service: username, password, and age or date or birth. If you are under 13 years of age, we also collect your parent’s email address so that we can provide notice or obtain consent for you to use the Service. If you are a student, please do not provide any personal information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you are able to sign up for the Service.

	iii. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent or notice as applicable (“Consent”). Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using certain features of the Service without Consent. For that reason, the signup flow for the Service requests the age of each new student user. By registering, you promise that you provided your real age during your signup, and you are either (a) over the age of 13 or (b) you gave us your parent or legal guardian’s actual and current email address, and that any response sent to Company in response comes from your parent or legal guardian.

> Basically,
> 
> **Students**: if you want to create a ClassDojo account and connect it with a class, you must be invited by a teacher. If you’re under 13, you have to get your parent’s permission.
> We collect minimal information from students to provide them with the ClassDojo service – usually just a username, password and their age (and a parent’s email address to ask for Consent when applicable).

b. **Teachers and school leaders**: if you are a teacher, school leader, aide, or other similar personnel accessing the Service on behalf of a school, school district, or other similar educational institution (the "Institution"), the following terms apply to you:

	i. You agree that you are acting on behalf of (or have permission from) your Institution to enter into this Agreement and to use the Service as part of your curriculum.

	ii. You further understand and acknowledge that COPPA prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without Consent and you understand that we will not let children under the age of 13 use certain features of the Service unless ClassDojo obtains verifiable parental consent from the child’s parent or legal guardian. ClassDojo will not provide full access to or use of the Service to students under the age of 13 that you invite to the Service if we are unable to obtain parental consent.

	iii. Only teachers and staff members who are current employees of the Institution may use the Service on the Institution’s behalf. Upon termination of a teacher or other staff member's employment with the Institution, such individual must return and cease using all login details and student access he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn a user of the Service claims to be affiliated with your Institution who is not, in fact, affiliated with your Institution, you will notify Company immediately.

> Basically,
> 
> **Teachers and school leaders**: Please be sure your school or district is fine with you using ClassDojo, and acting on behalf of your school in this Agreement.

c. Parents: if you are a parent of a Student that has been invited to create an account on the Service then the following terms apply to you:

	i. If your child is under the age of 13, Consent must be given in order for a student to use certain features of a ClassDojo student account. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who has created an account with us and you did not receive an email seeking your Consent, you can email us at privacy@classdojo.com to have that child’s account deleted. Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers. See our Privacy Policy for more details.

	ii. You further agree that we may send you messages, alerts, and other communications through the Service, including via email, web alert, text messages, push notifications and other similar means, in accordance with the preferences you set through the Service, and you agree to accept such messages, and pay any applicable network access, data usage, or similar fees.

> Basically,
> 
> **Parents**: if your child is under 13 and creates a ClassDojo account, we’ll need your permission to activate certain features on their account.

## FERPA

Certain information that may be provided to ClassDojo by teachers, school leaders, teacher aides, or other personnel at an Institution (“School Official”) that is directly related to a student and maintained by an Institution, may be considered an education record (“Education Record”) under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Additionally, certain information, provided to Company by School Officials about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA (“Directory Information”) and thus not an Education Record. A school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information from an eligible student’s education records to a third party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA (“FERPA Exemption(s)”), including the exemption for Directory Information (“Directory Information Exemption”) or disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest (“School Official Exemption”).

As a School Official or Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to ClassDojo, you represent, warrant and covenant to ClassDojo, as applicable, that your Institution has:

	i. complied with the Directory Information Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Institution deems to be directory information and allowing parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools not disclose directory information about them; and/or
	ii. complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their annual notification of FERPA rights that the Institution defines “school official” to include service providers and defines “legitimate educational interest” to include services such as the type provided by ClassDojo; or 
	iii. obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the Directory Information and Educational Records with Company, in each case, solely to enable Company’s operation of the Service.

ClassDojo will never share Education Records with third parties except (i) as directed by a ClassDojo user (i.e., teacher sharing with another teacher or parent); or (ii) to our service providers that are necessary for us to provide the Service, as stated in our Privacy Policy. A list of our current essential service providers is located here. Education Records are never used or disclosed for third party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or parents. Additionally, information collected directly from a student using ClassDojo is never used or disclosed for third party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information collected from a student is never sold or rented to anyone. This section shall not be construed (i) to prohibit ClassDojo from marketing or advertising directly to parents so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of Educational Records to provide behaviorally targeted advertising or (ii) to limit the ability of ClassDojo to use student information or Educational Records for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes.
 
ClassDojo may use Education Records that have been de-identified for product development, research or other purposes (“De-Identified Data”). De-Identified Data will have all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed, this includes, but is not limited to, name, date of birth, demographic information, location information and school identity. ClassDojo agrees not to attempt to re-identify the De-Identified Data and not to transfer the De-Identified Data to a third party unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification. 

> Basically,
>  
>  FERPA gives parents and students certain rights over their education records. FERPA requires schools to not share personal information in education records without either meeting an exemption or obtaining parental permission. So, if a teacher provides student information to ClassDojo, the school must either meet an exemption or obtain the appropriate permission in advance.

Your continued use of the Services, following notice of the changes to the Agreement or Guidelines, constitutes your acceptance of our amended terms, policies or guidelines. If you do not agree to the modified Agreement, you should discontinue your use of the Service. 

ClassDojo will not change how Education Records are used or shared under these Terms of Service without advance notice and consent from a School Official or Institution.

> Basically,
>  
> We respect copyright. If you see any violations, please see our DMCA Notification Guidelines.

## Third Parties and User Interactions

The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Company, and includes features that allow you to interact and communicate with third parties. When you access third party websites or interact or communicate with third parties through the Service, you do so at your own risk. Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites, or which are posted to or through the Service by other users. Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.

 **User Disputes**. ClassDojo is not responsible for the actions, content, information or data of other third parties, including other users.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes of a similar effect.

> Basically, 
>  
> We’re not responsible for any third party services, or any disputes you may have with them, or other users of ClassDojo.

## Termination

This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service. You may terminate your use of the Service or your account at any time by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com – parents, you can also terminate your child’s account the same way, although we will need to verify your identity (such as requiring that you send the request to us from the same email address you used to provide your consent to activate the student account originally). Company may suspend or terminate your access to the Service or your account at any time, for any reason (without cause or for your violation of any term of this Agreement), and without warning or notice, which may result in the loss of information associated with your account. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

> Basically, 
>  
> There is no obligation to use our Service, and you can stop using your account, or delete it completely, at any time. We can do that for you, too.

## Dispute Resolution

a. Generally: In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

b. Exceptions: Notwithstanding subsection (a), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

c. Arbitration: Any arbitration between you and Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company.

d. Notice; Process: A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Company's address for Notice is: Class Twist, Inc., 735 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.

e. Fees: In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

f. No Class Actions: you and company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

g. Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in this Section  shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.

> Basically, 
>  
> It is our goal to quickly and efficiently resolve disputes that may arise. For that reason, we require disputes to be submitted to arbitration. If you bring a dispute in arbitration that is $10,000 or less, ClassDojo will pay all the filing fees and make arrangements for non-appearance based proceedings (if you prefer). Additionally, we each waive rights to bring class actions.
