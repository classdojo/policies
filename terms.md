# ClassDojo Terms of Service

The following are the terms of service (“Terms of Service”) that define the relationship between ClassDojo, Inc. (doing business as ClassDojo (“Company,” “ClassDojo,” “we,” or “us”)) and you, and govern your use of ClassDojo’s services.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN A DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION [SECTION](#dispute-resolution), INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS AND WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH THE SERVICES.

We’ve done our best to write this policy in simple, clear terms. We’ve also added summaries below each section that provide short explanations of the legal language in plain English (it starts with ‘Basically...’) to aid in understanding, but it isn’t legally binding.

Last updated: November 2, 2018. You can see past versions of our Terms [here](https://github.com/classdojo/policies/blob/master/terms.md) on Github.

## Agreeing to our Terms

Thank you for your interest in ClassDojo, which owns and operates the services offered on classdojo.com (“ClassDojo Website”), including the ClassDojo platform (“ClassDojo Platform”), and any associated mobile applications (“ClassDojo Apps”) or products and services that Company may provide now or in the future (collectively, the “Service”).

These Terms of Service contain general terms that apply to you as a user of the ClassDojo Service ("User"), along with additional terms that may apply to you as a User registered as a teacher, school leader, aide, or other similar personnel ("School Personnel"), or a parent. If you are School Personnel, you will also be subject to our [Student Data Protection Addendum (“DPA”)](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2021-05-classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf). If you are purchasing any premium features like [Classdojo Plus (“Premium Features”)](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) through the ClassDojo Service or partake in any sweepstakes, giveaways, or promotions we may offer you will be subject to the [ClassDojo Premium Features and Promotions Terms](https://www.classdojo.com/premium-features-terms/). The DPA and the Premium Features and Promotions Terms (collectively "Terms") are hereby incorporated by reference.

When using the Service, you will also be subject to the [ClassDojo Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy) and any posted guidelines, policies or rules applicable to specific features of the Service, which may be posted from time to time (collectively the “Guidelines”). These Terms of Service, Terms, including any other Guidelines and future modifications (collectively, the “Agreement”), govern your use of the Service and is a legal contract between you and ClassDojo. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms of Service, Terms, and any of the Guidelines, the additional Guidelines will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. By registering for an account on, or otherwise accessing or using the ClassDojo Service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of an institution that has a separate written agreement with ClassDojo, that agreement governs your use of the Service.

If you are under the age of 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Agreement. If you don’t get your parent or guardian to read and agree to the Agreement, you don’t have permission to use the Service.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity (including if you are School Personnel entering on behalf of your school), you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms “you”, “your” or “User” shall refer to such entity. **If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the Service**.

>Basically,

>By using or signing up for ClassDojo, you agree to these terms. If you are under the age of 18, your legal guardian or parent will need to review and agree to the Agreement on your behalf. Welcome to the community!

Please visit our [Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy) for additional information on the types of information different types of Users are able to provide. Additionally, some User Content may be deemed an Education Record (as defined below).

School Personnel may contribute educational content, create answers to assessments, create activities for students to complete, create derivative works (e.g. completion of assignments) and transmit this data and content to ClassDojo (collectively “Activities”).

School Personnel and Users may submit feedback, comments or suggestions for improvements to the Services (in written, oral or any other form) (“Feedback”).

_Ownership_ 

Consistent with applicable law, as between ClassDojo and you, you (or your school as applicable) retain all ownership rights you have in any User Content. ClassDojo does not claim any ownership rights in the User Content. Please note that, while you retain ownership of your User Content, any template or layout in which you arrange or organize such User Content through tools and features made available through any of our Service are not proprietary to you — rights to such templates or layouts will remain with us or our service providers.

_License_ 

User Content

In order to allow ClassDojo to provide the Service, you hereby grant to us a limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable (as necessary to perform the Service, including distributing Activities, and providing the Premium Features), worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable (only to a successor) right and license to:

1. use, host, copy, store, distribute, publicly perform and display, publish (in whole or in part), modify, and create derivative works (such as changes we make so that your content works better with our Service) such User Content as necessary to (a) provide, improve and make the Service available to you and other Users including through any future media in which the Service may be distributed;
2. use and disclose metrics and analytics regarding the User Content in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in improving our service or in marketing and business development purposes); 
3. use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense Feedback without any compensation to you; 
4. use any User Content (including any Student Data or Education Record) that has been de-identified for any product development, research or other lawful purpose subject to the DPA; and
5. use for other purposes permitted by the [DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2020-03-ClassDojo_DPA.pdf) and the [ClassDojo Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy).

Company will only share and use your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) in accordance with ClassDojo’s current Privacy Policy at http://www.classdojo.com/privacy.

Activities

By default, if School Personnel contribute Activities, such Activities will be licensed royalty-free to ClassDojo under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (“CC License”), which is available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. Such Activities shall be available to the School Personnel's school and its Users, but ClassDojo may also sub-license such Activities to other Users of the Services at other schools. You acknowledge and agree that Activities will be licensed under the CC License unless you "opt-out" of sharing to other schools. Such Activities will continue to be licensed under the CC License until School Personnel “turns off” such sharing for that particular Activities. However, you understand and agree that if you "turn-off" sharing for Activities (i) the Activities will be available to Users within the School Personnel's school only; (ii) the change is prospective and does not terminate any sub-licenses to the underlying Activities previously granted by ClassDojo to any third parties (such as teachers from other schools and districts), and (iii) ClassDojo thereafter shall not grant any additional sub-licenses for the underlying Activities to third parties such as other schools.

_License Termination_
 
The license in 1(a) above will terminate when you or your Institution (as defined below) delete (i) any User Content with intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) (“IP content”)), (ii) personally identifiable information (such as that in Student Data or an Education Record), or (iii) your account. Such termination may not apply if your User Content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you post User Content in a [Class Story or School Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103), or [Portfolios](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732) this can be viewed by other teachers, students and parents and it means that you are allowing others to access and use that information and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture if you provide one as a teacher or parent).

Note, however, that any User Content that may be in an Education Record or Student Data (including User Content in or related to messages sent through [ClassDojo Messaging](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309), Class Story, or School Story or Portfolios, may be kept after you delete your account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g. maintenance of “education records” under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)). Please see the section entitled “Deleting your Account” in our Privacy Policy and our [deletion FAQs](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319) for more information. When you delete IP Content, Student Data, Education Records, or personal information, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer. However, you understand that any removed User Content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

_Your Responsibilities and ClassDojo Rights_ 

You agree that you, or your Institution, are responsible for making sure that you have all rights in the User Content, including the rights necessary for you to grant us the foregoing licenses to the User Content. Institution or School Personnel, as applicable, represents, covenants and agrees on behalf of yourself and your student Users that the submitting User (including your students) has all required rights to submit, post, upload or otherwise, own, use or disseminate the User Content it submits or uploads without violating any third-party rights. You are responsible for ensuring your User Content complies with the “[Acceptable Use and Conduct](#acceptable-use-and-conduct)” Section and for any other guidelines or conditions specific to a particular category of User (e.g., teacher, parent, or student). When you include User Content, you can create links to external websites. If you elect to create links to external websites, you must verify the quality and substance of each external link. You are solely responsible for any links you create to external websites. ClassDojo is not liable or responsible for any links created by you, or for any damages, direct or indirect, arising therefrom. 
 
All information posted or transmitted through the Service is the responsibility of the person that posted it, and we will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content. ClassDojo cannot guarantee the identity of any other Users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Service, or the authenticity of any data which users may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all content accessed by you using the Service is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. You acknowledge that ClassDojo and its designees (such as teachers) reserve the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, filter, edit, remove, refuse to accept, post, display, or transmit any User Content through or on the Service in whole or in part at any time for any reason or no reason with or without notice and without liability of any kind. Additionally, we do not guarantee that we will publish any of your User Content, and reserve the right to remove User Content from the Service at any time for any reason, such as if we receive a notice reports a User Content infringes someone’s intellectual property rights.

_Your Likeness _

While ClassDojo does not permit User Content containing personal information of Users under the age of 13 to be public, if you as a parent or School Personnel, upload any User Content to any area of our Service in areas that my be viewed by others (for example, in Class Story or School Story) containing your likeness or the likeness of others, you also agree to the following:

You consent to the use of your likeness, and you have obtained (as necessary) the written consent, release, and/or permission of every identifiable individual who appears in your User Content to use such individual's likeness, for purposes of using and otherwise exploiting the User Content in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, or, if any such identifiable individual is under the age of eighteen (18), you have obtained any necessary written consent, release and/or permission from such individual's parent or guardian (and you agree to provide to us a copy of any such consents, releases and/or permissions upon our request). If you do submit a submission that contains the likeness of an identifiable individual under the age of eighteen (18), we strongly encourage you not to include any identifying information (such as the individual's first and last name or address) with such User Content.

_Analyzing User Submissions_ 
Our automated systems analyze your User Content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, and for spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored. ClassDojo will not analyze any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) contained in Educational Records or Student Data for the purpose of providing [behaviorally-targeted advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) to students or parents. The foregoing shall not be construed to (i) prohibit ClassDojo from marketing or advertising directly to parents or other Users so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of personal information contained in Educational Records or Student Data obtained by ClassDojo from providing the Service (unless with parental/guardian consent), (ii) apply to the marketing of school memorabilia such as photographs, yearbooks or class rings, (iii) prohibit ClassDojo from using aggregate or [De-Identified Data](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#Deidentified) to inform, influence or enable marketing, advertising or other commercial efforts by ClassDojo, (iv) limit the ability of ClassDojo to use Educational Records or Student Data for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes, or (v) prohibit ClassDojo from using Student Data or Education Records to recommend educational products and services to parents/guardians, students or School Personnel so long as the recommendations are not based in whole or part in payment of other consideration from a third party.

>Basically,
>
>You (or your school as applicable) own any content you post on ClassDojo. You also give us permission to use it to provide the ClassDojo service to you and other Users. Our use of any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) you submit is also subject to our [Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy). You are responsible for making sure that you have all the rights in any information or content you submit to ClassDojo, including to grant us the license we need to provide the service. We do not guarantee that we will publish any of your content or information and we (or our designess, such as School Personnel) reserve the right (but have no obligation) to pre-screen, filter, or remove it from the service at any time, for any reason.

(ii) **Information Provided to ClassDojo:** We request minimal [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) to be provided from students to use the Service. Please see our children’s privacy [video](https://vid.ly/7d4i1b) for more information. If you are under 13 years of age, and you want a student account on ClassDojo, you will need to either (1) have the student account created at school by your teacher (only after the teacher represents to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) or acted as the agent of the parent and consented on their behalf) which allows you to then login to your student account using a [QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018581572), class text code, or [Google Login](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571), (2) receive a unique student code from your teacher to create your own account with a username (and/or email address) and password, or (3) have your parent create your student account after we have obtained [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) from them. If you are creating your own account in addition to the unique student code from your teacher, we will either ask you for (1) a username (and/or email address), password, and age or date or birth, as well as your parents email address so that we can provide notice or obtain consent for you to use the Service.  

Teachers will review any User Content you upload to the Service prior to them appearing in your [portfolio](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211828723) for parents to see, but other students in your class may see your User Content if they inadvertently login as you with the QR code given in class. If you are a student, please do not provide any personal information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you use the Service or as directed by your parent, teacher, school, or district, such as through the use of the Portfolios feature or use of Premium Features.

(iii) **Consent:** The [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions) prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent or notice as applicable (“Consent”). [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) may be obtained either by 1) ClassDojo if the parent is setting up a student account directly or allowing their child to use certain Premium Features within their parent account, or the student has received a [unique student code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145) from their teacher and is setting up their own account; or 2) a student’s teacher, school, or district if the teacher, school or district is setting up the student’s account and allowing the student to login (such as through the use of a [QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018581572), class text code, or [Google Login](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571)) or otherwise allowing students to access ClassDojo from school (“[School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986)”). Any student account (or access to a student account) created for the student by the parent, or the student’s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts, but rather the same singular account). Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using certain features of the Service without Consent, including, without limitation, student accounts. By using a student account on the Service, you promise that, if requested during your use of the Service, you provided your real age and that you are (a) over the age of 13; or (b) your parent (or you with the unique student code given to you by your teacher) has set up your student account and that any response sent to Company in response to Company seeking your parent’s consent comes from your parent or legal guardian; or (c) your teacher, school, or district has set up your student account or is otherwise allowing you to use the Service.

>Basically,
>
>Students: if you want to create a ClassDojo account, your account must be set up by a teacher or parent or you must be given a [unique student code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145) by your teacher to set up your own account. If you’re under 13, your parent must first give their permission or your school must have obtained your parent’s consent or acted as their agent and [consented](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) on their behalf . 
> 
>We collect minimal information from students in order to create a ClassDojo student account to provide them with the ClassDojo service – usually a username, password, email address (if they are using their Google Login), and their age (and a parent’s email address to ask for [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) when applicable). Parents and teachers may also create the account on the student’s behalf.

* * *

b) **School Personnel**: If you are a School Personnel accessing the Service on behalf of a school, school district, or other similar educational institution (the "Institution"), the following terms apply to you:

(i) **Permissions and Authority:** You agree that you are acting on behalf of (or have received all necessary permission from) your Institution to enter into this Agreement and to register and use the Service as part of your curriculum. Only School Personnel who are current employees of the Institution may use the Service on the Institution's behalf. The School Personnel is responsible for obtaining any necessary approvals from their school's authorities and administrators before using the Service. Upon termination of a School Personnel or other staff member's employment with the Institution, such individual must return and cease using all login details and student access he or she has in his or her possession.

(ii) **Students under 13:** You further understand and acknowledge that COPPA prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) from children under 13 years of age without Consent and you understand that we will not let children under the age of 13 use certain features of the Service unless:

1. ClassDojo obtains [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) from the child’s parent or legal guardian if 1) the parent is creating an account for the student on ClassDojo or allowing the student to access and use the Services on the parent device; or 2) the student has created their own student account using the unique student code given to them by their teacher; or
2. You obtain [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) in situations where you set up the child’s student account on their behalf to enable them to then log in (such as through the use of a [QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018581572), class text code, or [Google Login](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571)) or otherwise allow the student to access certain features of the Service in the classroom which may result in the collection of personal information from the child. ClassDojo will not provide use of student accounts or access to the Service to children under the age of 13 if we are unable to obtain Consent or learn that you have not obtained School Consent. You agree that you will not knowingly create a child’s student account on their behalf or allow the child to use the Service in the classroom until you have obtained [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986).

(iii) **School Consent**. You acknowledge and agree that when [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) must be utilized to allow children under 13 to use the Service, you and/or the Institution will be solely responsible (and hereby agree that ClassDojo is not responsible) for 1) providing all required notices to parents under COPPA; 2) obtaining parental consent (or if allowed by your Institution’s policy, acting as the agent of the parent and consenting on their behalf) under COPPA; and 3) providing a means for a parent to review any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) contained in Student Data collected through the Service and refuse to permit its further use as required by COPPA. This includes without limitation, limiting access to the Service to those student Users from whom School Personnel has received valid Consent forms and complying with all parental requests regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such parent’s child’s information. School Personnel or the Institution are responsible for disseminating any required parental consent forms to the parents of potential student Users, for confirming receipt of valid consent forms for each child before granting the student access to the Service, and for retaining such consent forms on file. If a parent User does not consent or rescinds such School Consent, School Personnel or the Institution shall immediately notify ClassDojo to discontinue that student’s access to the Service and ensure that such student’s information is no longer accessible through the Services. For more information on School Consent please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986). Under no circumstances will ClassDojo be liable for the School Personnel’s failure to consult their school's authorities and administrators or for failing to obtain School Consent when required.

(iv) **Parent Code**. Each student the teacher inputs on ClassDojo is assigned a [unique parent code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730289). This unique parent code is required for parents to connect with their child’s updates from school on ClassDojo. Parents may register for an account on ClassDojo without the unique parent code, including to utilize the [Premium Features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732), but will be unable to connect with their child’s school to see their child’s or the school’s updates. Parents with a ClassDojo account may give Consent for their child to have a Student Created Account (as defined below) on ClassDojo. It is your responsibility to ensure that each student only shares his/her parent code with his/her parents. School Personnel may also find more suitable means to communicate the parent code to the parent, including by sending home a private letter to the student's parent or otherwise contacting the parent directly. Alternatively, if the School Personnel has access to the student's parent contact information and has permission to do so, the School Personnel may provide ClassDojo with a list of parent email addresses or phone numbers for ClassDojo to send the parent code at the direction of and on behalf of the School Personnel embedded in a link to parents (via email or SMS) to click through in order to create a parent account and additionally give Consent.

(v) **Portfolios**. If you choose to use the [Portfolios](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732) feature in your classroom, the following conditions and limitations apply:

1. Using the Portfolios feature, you may elect to allow students to directly contribute User Content, including Student Activity Responses, to their Portfolios after you have set up their student account on their behalf. It is your responsibility to decide whether to set up the student account on the student’s behalf and to grant permission to such student to submit User Content. ClassDojo is not responsible for the selection of students given access to the Portfolios feature in your classroom.
2. It is your responsibility to ensure that only the applicable students can access the class [QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004688443) and that students are only signing in and choosing their own Student Account. In addition, you agree that you will not knowingly create a Student Account on their behalf until you have obtained School Consent (if required) from the student’s parent or legal guardian. It is your responsibility to obtain School Consent.
3. All User Content submitted for display, including any Activities, Student Activity Responses and Portfolio Comments, on the Service directly by you or by students via the Portfolios feature must be reviewed by you in accordance with, and are subject to, this Agreement, including those terms and conditions set forth in the “[Acceptable Use and Conduct](#acceptable-use-and-conduct)” and “[Your Information and Content](#your-information-and-content)” Sections.

Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that once a Student Activity Response is reviewed and accepted by you to be posted on the student’s portfolio, that all associated Portfolio Comments can be viewed by the child’s parent.

(vi) **Google Login.** If you choose to allow your students to log in on the Service using their Google for Education or other Google Accounts (“Google Login(s)”), you are responsible for educating your students on the proper use of their Google Login, including to help educate your students on better protecting their Google Login by turning on [two-factor authentication](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/). Note that ClassDojo does not request or store passwords associated with any Google Logins. Please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571) for more information on what we collect through the use of Google Login and how we use that information.

2. You understand that if you ever need to remove Activities you can do so within the Activities area of your account.

You are solely responsible for the content of all Activities and Activities Feedback you leave for other teachers, including any personal information contained therein and for ensuring that material meets all applicable conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those in the “Your Information and Content” and “Acceptable Use and Conduct” Sections.

>Basically,

>Please be sure your school or district is fine with you using ClassDojo, and acting on behalf of your school in this Agreement. Additionally, if you are creating student accounts in the classroom for students under 13 to enable them to login to their accounts with a QR code, class text code, or Google Login, or otherwise allowing students under 13 to use the Service, you will be responsible for obtaining [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) under COPPA. You are also responsible for reviewing any content submitted by your students (regardless of age) and for ensuring it complies with our [Content Submission Guidelines](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456823). Additionally, if you allow your students to login to the Service through the use of a QR code, you are responsible for ensuring that student only logs in to his or her own account. If you use any Parent Communications tools, you must only use for educational subject matter and must abide by our [Parent Communication Guidelines](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456823).

c) Parents: if you are a parent of a student and have been invited by the your child’s School Personnel to create a parent account on the Service (linking your parent account to your child’s class with a unique parent code), or create a parent account not linked using a unique parent code, and you also (i) want to create an account for your child on the Service, (ii) allow your child to create their own account (“Student Created Accounted”), (iii) allow your child’s School Personnel to create an account on your child’s behalf, or (iv) allow your child to access or use Premium Features on your device, then the following terms apply to you:

(i) **Your Consent.** If your child is under the age of 13, [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) must be given in order for 1) you to create the student account; or 2) your child to create a Student Created Account; or 3) your child’s School Personnel to create a student account on behalf of your child, enabling them to login using a [QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018581572), class text code, or [Google Login](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571). This Consent may be obtained either by: 1) ClassDojo if you or your child is setting up the Student Created Account or you are allowing your child to access or use Premium Features on your device or account; or 2) a student’s School Personnel (through [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986)) if they are setting up your child’s Student Account, enabling them to login using a QR code, class text code, or Google Login, or otherwise allowing them to access and use the Service in school. Any student account created by you, your child’s teacher, or your child directly are linked together (these are not different accounts, but rather the same singular account). If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who is using the Service and your child’s account was not set up by your child’s School Personnel, and you did not give Consent, you can email us at privacy@classdojo.com to have that child’s account deleted. Please note that if you, as a parent, provide an email to School Personnel when the school is obtaining School Consent, we may send an email asking you to verify your child’s account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service. 

(ii) **Text, SMS and Other Messaging.** ClassDojo, on behalf of and at the direction of an Institution, may send parents/legal guardians informational text messages from your child's Institution, including, but not limited to, messages: (1) providing information related to their or their child’s use of the Services; (2) supplying information that they request; or (3) responding to their inquiries regarding their account or use of ClassDojo. If you as a parent/legal guardian, provide your telephone number to your child’s school, you are consenting to ClassDojo (on behalf of and at the direction of your child’s school) sending informa[QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018581572)tional text messages closely related to the Institution’s mission. If you have created an account on the Service, and have provided ClassDojo directly with your phone number or email, you further agree that we may send you messages, alerts, and other communications through the Service, including via email, web alert, text messages, push notifications and other similar means, in accordance with the preferences you set through the Service.

ClassDojo does not charge you for our text message features. But message and data rates may apply, so depending on your plan with your wireless or other applicable provider, you may be charged by your carrier or other applicable provider. 

(ii) **Creating Your Child’s Account.** If you would like to create your child’s student account at home, you must first have created a parent account on ClassDojo. To create your child’s student account, we will first require your [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603). In order to comply with COPPA and similar laws in other applicable jurisdictions, which govern the online collection of data from children, Classdojo may take additional steps to verify that the user granting permission for the creation of a child’s student account is his or her parent or legal guardian. The current ways in which we seek to verify are set forth in our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043). As part of the process of creating your child’s student account, we will link the information given by your child’s teacher (such as your child’s name and [feedback points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125)) to your child’s student account and you will not need to provide any additional registration information for your child. Additionally, instead of creating a password for your child’s account, your child will log in with the [QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004685926) that is generated once you Consent and create the student account. In order to protect the security of your child's account, you should keep this QR code confidential. 
 
Once your child has a student account (including if your child created their own Student Created Account (after you have [Consented](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603)) or your child’s teacher has created the student account on your child’s behalf, they will be able to upload User Content, including Student Activity Responses, to the student account and [Portfolios](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211828723) (which is not viewable by the general public, but by linked parents and School Personnel). You are responsible for ensuring that such submissions (when not used during school) meet all applicable conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those in “[Your Information and Content](#your-information-and-content)” and the “[Acceptable Use and Conduct](#acceptable-use-and-conduct)” Sections. You can request to remove any User Content uploaded by your child either by 1) contacting your child’s School Personnel if the User Content was uploaded during school, and we will respond to valid requests received from the School Personnel or Institution, or 2) contacting us directly at privacy@classdojo.com when the User Content is collected directly from your child while not at school, including when ClassDojo obtains the parent consent directly (not the school). 

(ii) **Premium Features **. If you are accessing or using the Premium Features, or allowing your child to access and use, you will also be subject to the [Premium Features and Promotions Terms](https://www.classdojo.com/premium-features-terms/). Additionally, if you are allowing your child to access and use Premium Features on your device or account, we will first require your [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603). In order to comply with COPPA and similar laws in other applicable jurisdictions, which govern the online collection of data from children, Classdojo may take additional steps to verify that the user granting permission to allow the child to use the Premium Features is his or her parent or legal guardian. The current ways in which we seek to verify are set forth in our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043).

>Basically,
>
>Parents: if your child is under 13 and you create a ClassDojo student account for them at home, allow them to access Premium Features on your device or account, or they create one with a [unique student code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145), we’ll need your [permission](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) to set up their account. If your child’s teacher or other school personnel wants to create your child’s student account on their behalf, they will obtain your permission (or, depending on school policy, act as your agent and consent on your behalf in what is commonly referred to as “school consent”).

## FERPA

ClassDojo understands that it is important that our partner schools comply with the [Family Education Rights and Privacy Act](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) ("FERPA") and related regulations. Certain information that may be provided to ClassDojo by School Personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an Institution, may be considered an [education record](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004773623) (“Education Record”) under FERPA. Additionally, certain information, provided to Company by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered [directory information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004773623) under FERPA (“Directory Information”) and thus not an Education Record. Please see our [DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2020-03-ClassDojo_DPA.pdf) for more information regarding FERPA, ClassDojo’s commitments to help Institution’s comply with FERPA, and Institution’s obligations with respect to FERPA. 
ClassDojo is not in a position to provide legal advice regarding whether the school's existing FERPA disclosures are sufficient. To the extent that School Personnel have questions regarding these issues, they should consult the school's own legal counsel for more information.

>Basically,
>
>FERPA gives parents and students certain rights over their [education records](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004773623). FERPA requires schools to not share [PII](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5177ee2981c26c75fa0c88df117d75a8&node=34:1.1.1.1.33.1.134.3&rgn=div8) in education records without either meeting an exemption or obtaining parental permission. So, if a teacher provides student information to ClassDojo, the school must either meet an exemption or obtain the appropriate permission in advance. Please see our [DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2020-03-ClassDojo_DPA.pdf) for more information regarding FERPA, ClassDojo’s commitments to help Institution’s comply with FERPA, and Institution’s obligations with respect to FERPA.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

## Term and Termination

This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service unless your account is terminated as provided in this Agreement (“Term”). Certain Users (e.g., parents and School Personnel) may terminate their use of the Service or your account at any time by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com provided, however, that an Institution may require satisfaction of certain requirements before School Personnel can terminate their account. As a parent, if you created your child’s account (or your child is not using the Service at school), you can also terminate your child’s account the same way, although we will need to verify your identity (such as requiring that you send the request to us from the same email address you used to provide your consent to activate the student account originally). Parents of students whose accounts were created (or directed to be used by) your child’s teacher in school will first need to contact your child’s school to request termination. Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319) for what information is deleted when you terminate or delete your account. 

You acknowledge that, if you knowingly, intentionally or negligently violate this Agreement, ClassDojo may suspend your license to the Services, in whole or in part, until the violation has stopped or terminate your license and use of the Services. In the event that you fail to correct the violation after reasonable notice from ClassDojo, ClassDojo may terminate your license and use of the Services and this Agreement. You agree and if such termination or suspension occurs, ClassDojo shall bear no responsibility or liability for any damages or claims resulting from or in connection with such actions, including the loss of information associated with your account. 
 
The following does not apply in the unforeseen circumstances in which ClassDojo ceases operations or files for bankruptcy at which point ClassDojo may terminate or suspend all User accounts and licenses with or without notice to you, and with no liability to you. We believe that you (or your school as applicable) own your data and preserving access to such data is important. If we discontinue the Service (such as if we went out of business), where reasonably possible, we will give you advance notice and a chance to get information out of the Service. Click [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004809286) for more information.

>Basically,
>
>There is no obligation to use our Service, and you can stop using your account, or delete it completely, at any time. We can do that for you, too. However, if you are a student (or parent of a student) - you (or you parent) must first contact your school if you wish to terminate your account created at your school and your school can tell you what the process will be. Additionally, we might suspend or terminate your account if you violate our rules or the law. 

* * *

## Dispute Resolution

a) Generally: In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

b) Exceptions: Notwithstanding subsection (a), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

c) Arbitration: Any arbitration between you and Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company.

d) Notice; Process: A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Company's address for Notice is: Class Twist, Inc., 735 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.

e) Fees: In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

f) No Class Actions: you and company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

g) Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in this Section shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.

>Basically,
>
>It is our goal to quickly and efficiently resolve disputes that may arise. For that reason, we require disputes to be submitted to arbitration. If you bring a dispute in arbitration that is $10,000 or less, ClassDojo will pay all the filing fees and make arrangements for non-appearance based proceedings (if you prefer). Additionally, we each waive rights to bring class actions.

* * *

## Miscellaneous

The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company's reasonable control.

Company may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without restriction. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. To the extent any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such claim shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and for all purposes of this Agreement, you and Company consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Unless and solely to the extent that you or your Institution have a separate written agreement with Company that governs your use of the Service (in which case such agreement will control), we both agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that the Agreement may not be modified, except as otherwise provided herein. This Agreement and any subsequent versions of this Agreement posted to the Website will be deemed a writing signed by both parties. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any respect whatsoever.
