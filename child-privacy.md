# CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: January 27th 2022 

*HOW DOES CLASSDOJO PROTECT CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION?*

Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us - we’re educators and parents ourselves, after all. This is why we’ve signed the Student Privacy Pledge and received iKeepSafe’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) Safe Harbor seal, signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed and approved for compliance with iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor program. COPPA protects the online privacy of children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”); for more information about COPPA and generally protecting children’s online privacy, please visit [OnGuard Online](http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online).

We’ve also made a [short video](http://vid.ly/6l7i1p) for students that highlights the most important details in our Privacy Policy that they should know about. We also have a [Student Data Protection Addendum](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2021-05-classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf), an agreement we enter into with schools, that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to [Student Data](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca) that we collect or receive. 

This Children’s Privacy Policy explains our information, collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children, and uses terms that are defined in our general Services Privacy Policy.  For our full Services Privacy Policy please see [here](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy/).  This policy is in accordance with the U.S. COPPA.

## What Information Does ClassDojo Collect From Children, and How is it Used?

The statements we make regarding the information we collect from or about students and children using ClassDojo through a [Student Account or an Outside School Child Account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205), such as those using our Premium Features at home who may or may not be connected to a school, and how we use this information applies equally to all students and [Outside School Child Users](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205) regardless of their age. Accordingly, where this Privacy Policy references students or any information collected from or about students (including Outside School Child Users), our Privacy Policy applies to students under 13 years old as well as students 13 years old and above. Please note, however, that for Outside School Child Users, we have different data retention policies as this information would not be retained beyond account deletion as may be required under FERPA or other state student privacy laws for “education records” or [“Student Data”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca).

ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students and Outside School Child Users necessary to register for an account on the Service. This information is necessary to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service and for security and safety purposes. Additionally, ClassDojo follows the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) COPPA rules for parental consent, including, where applicable, the use of which is commonly referred to a [“school consent”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986-For-teachers-Getting-consent-from-parents) if a school or teacher elects to utilize ClassDojo in the classroom.  For more detail on the categories of personal information collected from students and Outside School Child Users, as well as the sources from which the information was collected, the purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom we share such personal information please see [here](https://classdojo.com/transparency).

**Student Account and Outside School Child Account Creation**

Currently, Student Accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent; (2) by the student’s teacher; or (3) by the student themselves.  A parent may also set up an Outside School Child Account.

*(1) By the parent:*
When a parent sets up a Student Account for their child, they will first need to [create a parent account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205417305-Create-a-Parent-Account#web) and [connect to their child’s class](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050894111-How-Do-I-Connect-to-My-Child-s-Class-#web). Parents can also set up their account without connecting to their child’s class, but will not be connected to their child’s school (or any activity on their child’s account in school). In accordance with COPPA, we may ask the parent to provide the date of birth or age of their child, and if the child is under 13, we will also then seek to obtain verifiable [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046) in order to proceed with creating their child’s account. If a parent is connected to their child’s school, we don’t ask the child’s parent for any additional information regarding their child during the Student Account creation but link the account to the name and information provided by the child’s teacher. The parent may choose to provide additional information - such as their child’s date of birth. If the parent is not connected to their child’s school, the parent may provide their child’s first and last name (at the option of the parent) and can create the Outside School Child Account. Once we have obtained parental consent, the child’s account will be set up and accessible by [toggling from the parent account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026692752-Toggle-Between-Your-Parent-and-Student-Accounts#ios) or by [accessing the child's individual QR code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060108292-Access-Your-Child-s-Individual-QR-Code#ios).  Once the child is connected to a school, the parent may also access the Student Account through the [Student Login Methods](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004708883-How-Does-My-Child-Log-into-Their-Student-Account-at-Home-to-Post-to-Their-Portfolio-#web).  Although not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students and Outside School Child Accounts 13 and above at our discretion.

*(2) By the student’s teacher:*
If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize Student Accounts in school or otherwise sets up a student’s account, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) under COPPA (including if they choose to act as the agent of the parent and consent on the parent’s behalf - commonly referred to as “school consent” under COPPA) to create the Student Account on behalf of the student and let students access their accounts. The teacher will provide the student’s name to set up the account, and possibly the student’s date of birth. After doing so, if the teacher is creating the Student’s Account, the teacher will be able to share a [student login method](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210542566-How-Do-I-Log-Into-My-Student-Account-%23web&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1622750088523000&usg=AOvVaw0Vab-6AzLuz1m_C5Asq3Od). Additionally, teachers may choose to allow students to log in on the Service using their Google for Education or other Google Accounts (“Google Login(s)”). Please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571) for more information on Google Login. We don’t ask students to enter any other [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) for their account registration when a teacher sets up their account. Please note that if you, as a parent, provide an email to the school when the school is obtaining [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986), we may send an email out to you asking you to verify your child’s account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service. For more information on school consent, please see the [FTC’s COPPA FAQs](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#Schools).

*(3) By the student:*
Alternatively, a teacher may choose to allow students to set up their own Student Account. When students set up their own ClassDojo Student Account, we may ask students to provide a unique username, or their email, and a password. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for the child’s age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046) or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided this way to market our Service to the parent unless the parent has opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. **We don’t ask students to enter any other [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) when setting up an account.**

We also receive from the child’s teacher (and link to the Student’s Account) whatever name he or she has provided for the student as mentioned above, the student’s grade, the school name and location, the list and names of classes the student is in, the names of the teachers of that student, [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) given by that teacher, and content uploaded by the teacher to the student’s portfolio (such as Activities and Portfolio Comments). Teachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; they can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name and seat number). [This chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) details the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.

Any Student Account (or access to a Student Account) created for the student by the parent, or the student’s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts). Additionally, any Outside School Child Account will also be linked with the Student Account (if both exist), but only certain content will be viewable by the child’s teacher. Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085) for more details.

**Photos, Videos, Documents, Drawings, Student Activity Responses, and Journal Entries in Student Accounts**

Once a Student Account is created (whether created by the student’s teacher or parent or the student themself) and [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) is obtained, students will be able to post in their Student Accounts.  This includes responding to teacher [Activities](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046897531-How-to-Assign-an-Activity-to-a-Group-or-Individual-Students-within-a-Class#web) with [Student Activity Responses](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009899492-How-Do-I-Use-Activities-to-Assign-Classwork-or-Homework-to-My-Students-#web) or [adding items] (such as photos, videos, and documents) to their ClassDojo Portfolio- which will be collected by ClassDojo once the content has been actively saved by the child within the Service. Until the content is actively saved by the child, it is temporarily stored locally on the child’s device. 
The student’s teacher must [approve](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022768191-How-are-student-posts-approved-before-sharing-with-their-families-) the post made by students in their Student Account on their portfolios, including any [Student Activity Responses](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy/#what-is-classdojo), before it is shared with parents on Portfolios. Once a post has been approved by the teacher, any subsequent comments or replies to that post by the student will be added without approval by the teacher and also become visible to the parent. Any content uploaded by a student in their Student Account in the classroom by their teacher, parent, or themselves, or by the child or parent in their Outside School Child Account, will appear visible in both accounts.  However, certain content uploaded in the Outside School Child’s Account will not be viewable by the teacher in the Student Account. Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085) for more details.

**Portfolio Comments in Student Accounts**

If a student’s teacher has elected to provide [Portfolio Comments](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy/#what-is-classdojo) on their [Student Activity Responses](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy/#what-is-classdojo) or on any other content uploaded by students to Portfolios, the student may also respond to these comments. Prior to the approval of portfolio content by the child’s teacher as mentioned above, any Portfolio Comments between the teacher and the student can’t be viewed by the student’s parent, but any connected parents will [receive a notice](​​https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415239472525) indicating that Portfolio Comments is being utilized by their child’s teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child’s teacher. Once the Student Activity Responses (or other content) have been approved by the student’s teacher, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable by the parent (but may have been previously edited by the student’s teacher). Please note that additional Portfolio Comments on a previously approved portfolio post are not first approved by the student’s teacher before being posted on the student’s portfolio. 

**Viewing and Commenting on Stories through Student Accounts**

Students with Student Accounts may also view or “like” content on the Class Story and School Story and [provide comments](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207430766-How-to-Enable-Disable-and-Delete-Comments-on-a-Class-Story-Post#web), however, they will not be able to post content (such as videos or photos) to either the Class Story or School Story. Currently, students are limited to posting content to just their own portfolio or through access to the Premium Features given to them by their parents. Teachers have the ability to [turn off the commenting feature](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207430766#web) for students as well and can delete any individual user comment. Parents will also [be notified](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415239472525) when their child posts a comment in a Class Story or School Story.  If any user needs to [report any abuse](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040332952) or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at privacy@classdojo.com. 

**Premium Features (Student Accounts and Outside School Child Account)**

Parents may choose to allow their children to access and use certain [Premium Features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) within the child’s Student Account or their Outside School Child’s Account. A parent will first need to have their own parent account and be required to use either their Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method, to purchase the Premium Features. If a parent is purchasing Premium Features from within their child’s Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account on their mobile device, they will also need to go through a “[parental gate](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413226632845
)” prior to purchasing. Prior to allowing your child (or children) access to their Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account in order to access the Premium Features, we will also require [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603). Once we have obtained parental consent, the children’s features will be unlocked for their children to utilize within their Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account. Although not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students or children 13 and above at our discretion. A parent can award Home Points as well as [Rewards](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024317332-How-You-Can-Redeem-Home-Points-for-Your-Child#ios) and [Skills](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022742252-Add-New-Skills-for-Points-at-Home-with-ClassDojo-Plus#ios) to a child for educational and other learning activities completed at home. These Home Points can also be used to [react to activities](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024599731-Give-Points-at-Home-with-ClassDojo-Plus#ios) occurring within their child’s class. The Home Points may be combined with the Feedback Points earned in school. The combined set of Home Points and Feedback Points given at school may be used by the child at the [ClassDojo Shop](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415027230221) and all points (Home Points or Feedback Points in school) are collected by ClassDojo and may be used by ClassDojo to provide the Service, including providing certain Premium Features (e.g. enhanced reports), sending [push notifications](#push-notifications) or other [in-app notifications](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231726733). This content related to Home Points, Rewards, and Skills is then viewable by the parent and child within the Premium Features section of their respective account and is not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students.  This content can be deleted by the parent or child. 

In addition, the child can customize their monster with additional monster parts available with Premium Features, including through the [ClassDojo Shop](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415027230221) and these changes to their monster may be shown in their Student Account in class. Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Beyond-School-FAQ) for more details.

**Monster Island**

If a child’s parent has given [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046-For-parents-What-consent-must-parents-give-for-their-child-to-use-ClassDojo-), their child, using their Outside School Child Account, may visit a virtual world with their ClassDojo monster where they can engage in various activities and interact with other children (including their classmates) outside of the classroom (“Monster Island”).  Additionally, your child’s teacher can specifically choose to turn on the ability for students to utilize Monster Island in the classroom with their Student Account. Please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085), for more details on what other children may see about your child while in Monster Island and how children can interact with each other.  We will collect product events (e.g. what activities inside the Monster Island a child has completed along with their score (e.g. 200 coins earned for completing an adventure) and how many times (or how) the child has decorated their own island or monster.  These are collected to provide the Service, including for internal analysis on product usage and quality.  We may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending [push notifications](Children's Section PP 10 11 21.docx) to the child’s device to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service.  The child may also interact with the [ClassDojo Shop](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415027230221) while in the Monster Island, including customizing their ClassDojo monster.
 
**Location Information**

We never request precise location data from students or Outside School Child Users and no student location data is available publicly.  From students, and Outside School Child Users, the primary form of location data is based on IP Addresses.  If students or Outside School Child Users upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone's camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo’s own application camera, we collect what the device sends us.  If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file - e.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data).  We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the parent in Portfolios).  If a student or Outside School Child User accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device’s own camera roll).

**Automatically Collected Information**

In addition to the information listed above, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "[Information collected automatically](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy/#information-collected-automatically)" section, this includes device data (such as platform, app version, and device ID) and product event data (such as the last activity a child started or whether they viewed a certain report) from the child’s device, such as for Premium Features, Monster Island or logging in via QR code to their Student Account on the parent's device. These are collected for internal analysis on product usage and quality and we may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending [push](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204474325-How-do-push-notifications-work-for-student-accounts-) or email notifications to the child (as set forth below) to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service.

We use the information we collect from students and Outside School Child Users to provide and improve the Service to the child, for [educational](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#EducationalPurposes), security and safety purposes, as authorized by law, or to enforce our Terms.  Additionally, we use the information we collect from Outside School Child Users as set forth [here](https://classdojo.com/transparency). We will not require children to provide more [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information or immediately seek the [parent's consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third-parties, except to [service providers](#service-providers) necessary to provide the Service, authorized school personnel (such as school leaders), as directed by the child's school or as directed or approved the child’s parents (such as through Monster Island, as required by [law](#legal-requirements), or to protect the security of the Service or other users. Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for [third-party advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_6fb13f0c-b840-412f-9956-2a519005384d). We also do not place any third-party advertisements in student logged-in areas of the Service. Additionally, personal information collected from students is **never** used for [behaviorally-targeted advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#BehaviorallyTargetedAdvertising) to students by us or any third-party, and children’s personal information is **never** [sold](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_ac14c75d-d951-44ea-9140-eef33ca14bee) or rented to anyone, including marketers and advertisers. We may present contextually relevant educational content (not using student personal information) for either our own products (e.g. Premium Features) or third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to a student (e.g., our co-created content with [Yale University on Mindfulness](https://ideas.classdojo.com/b/mindfulness) and Heart of a Champion series) or Outside School Child User.

>Basically,

>ClassDojo has been certified by iKeepSafe, an FTC-approved COPPA Safe Harbor, for compliance with their COPPA Safe Harbor program. We don’t ask for or require children to provide [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) beyond that which is reasonably necessary to use ClassDojo. Information collected from students or Outside School Child Users is **never** used or disclosed for [third-party advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_6fb13f0c-b840-412f-9956-2a519005384d) or any kind of [behaviorally-targeted advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#BehaviorallyTargetedAdvertising), and it is **never** [sold](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_ac14c75d-d951-44ea-9140-eef33ca14bee) or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers. Please see [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) for the detailed categories of information we collect from each user type and how we use the information, as well as the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.

## Push Notifications

ClassDojo may send [push notifications](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204474325-How-do-push-notifications-work-for-student-accounts-) to students or Outside School Child Users. We require children to provide a parent’s email address before he or she can receive push notifications from ClassDojo (or have a Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account previously set up on ClassDojo by their parent or teacher, with any necessary [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) obtained). We will then provide the parent with notice (if the account was set up by them or their child) that the push notifications are being sent to their child. The device identifier for a child’s account will only be associated with other [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) once parental consent is provided. These push notifications may contain information about taking an action in the Service, such as the child completing a task or other product feature or informing the child their parent has purchased additional monster parts for them. If you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer want these communications to be sent, please either turn off the push notifications on your device or contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.

>Basically,
>
>Before ever sending a push notification to a child, if the child or the parent sets up the child’s account on the Service, we will provide notice to parents, or obtain parental consent. We rely on teachers to obtain any necessary [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) if they set up the child’s account and the push notifications are related to classroom use. Parents can always opt-out (or withdraw consent) later as well by turning off the push notifications on their child’s device or contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com.

## What Children’s Information is Visible to Others?

No [Student’s Account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422155), or Outside School Child’s Account, profile, or [portfolio](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732-What-is-ClassDojo-Portfolios-and-How-Does-it-Work-) is made available or visible to the general public through ClassDojo.  For a list of what logged in student users and Outside School Child User’s information can be viewed by other logged in ClassDojo users, please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085). 

**School Use**

For student’s using ClassDojo in the classroom (or at home in connection with school use), only the student, the student’s connected parent account(s), and the student’s teachers (including those outside the child’s school that are connected to the child) or school leaders can see the student’s individual Student Account and portfolio. Other students in that child’s class may see the child’s avatar, and name If a student adds content to their Student Account in the classroom, students can’t view each other’s individual Student Accounts or portfolio unless they have intentionally chosen another student’s name from the list of names shown to them while logging in or viewed the camera roll locally on the device that may be saving photos and videos taken by students. Teachers also have the option to use [individual QR codes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018581572) specific to each student for private and individual login purposes. Please note that if the teacher chooses to project their own ClassDojo teacher account in their classroom, students physically present in that classroom may see other students’ names and total [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) - this is similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work. Teachers, however, can choose to never project or display their own teacher account in class, and therefore keep student Feedback Points and Portfolios private for each student, their teacher(s), and their parents — and many do!

No child can upload content (such as Student Activity Response, photo, video, drawing, journal entry, or document) to a portfolio or otherwise on the Service (such as commenting on Class Stories) for school use except through their Student Account. This can’t happen for children without either (1) the parent providing [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046) directly to ClassDojo or (2) the child’s teacher representing to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986), including acting as the agent of the parent if their school policy allows. Additionally, the student’s teacher [must approve](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022768191-How-are-student-posts-approved-before-sharing-with-their-families-) the post made by students through their Student Account, before it is shared with parents on the student’s portfolio.  Once a post has been approved by the teacher, any subsequent comments or replies to that post by the student will be added without approval by the teacher and also become visible to the parent. Parents are able to view their own child’s portfolio (through their own parent account) after the teacher has approved the student-submitted content as mentioned above, including Student Activity Responses. Please note that parents may not see prior drafts of the student-submitted content or Portfolio Comments prior to the final teacher approval that allows parents to access and view and may not see all [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125-What-are-feedback-points-) awarded by the teacher in school if the teacher has elected not to show these.

[Class Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103) and [School Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103) are visible to students, teachers, parents, and school leaders who have logged into their accounts and are associated with that particular class or school, and all content added by any user may be seen by other logged-in users with access to these Stories, as well as the user’s name and (for students) their ClassDojo monster posted next to the comment or content. They are not visible to the general public. Parents, teachers, and school leaders can add content or comments to these stories. Students can view or “like” content and comment on these stories (but can’t upload content such as photos or videos) and are only able to do this once either the school or ClassDojo has obtained parental consent, if under 13.  Teachers have the ability to [turn off](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207430766#web) the Story commenting feature for students and parents as well and can delete any individual user comment.  If any user needs to [report any abuse](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040332952) or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at privacy@classdojo.com. 

Teachers may [share their classes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202027909), including Feedback Points, Portfolios, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders in their school (or outside of their school). 

**Outside School Child Account, Monster Island, and ClassDojo Plus Features Used Outside of School**

Content uploaded by children or Home Points, [Rewards]https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024317332-How-You-Can-Redeem-Home-Points-for-Your-Child#ios), or  [Skills ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022742252-Add-New-Skills-for-Points-at-Home-with-ClassDojo-Plus#ios) awarded within the Outside School Child’s Account or Premium Features (when used outside of school) is viewable by the parent and any children accessing such Premium Features outside of school within their respective accounts or those users that the parent [allows access](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027698012-How-Can-I-Share-my-ClassDojo-Plus-Subscription-#ios); the content is not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students.  For Outside School Child Users, if the child is also utilizing certain features [approved by the child’s parent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046), such as ClassDojo Plus, or [Monster Island](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085) then other children and users may view content and interact with each other as set forth [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085).  Additionally, the customization of the monster by the child within Premium Features or the Monster Island may be viewable within the child’s Student Account (and thus viewable by the child’s teacher or other students in the classroom).

>Basically,
>
>Student Accounts: By default, the full set of feedback and content posted, including Portfolio Comments and Student Activity Responses, to a Student’s Account is private to the student, their teacher(s), school leader, and connected parent account(s) (once the content is approved by the teacher). If a teacher displays their teacher account publicly in class, then students may see other students’ total Feedback Points, and potentially classwork on Portfolios. Parents can view all teacher-approved posts, including Portfolio Comments and Student Activity Responses, shared on their child’s portfolio, as well as every post shared on Class Story and School Story. Students can view, “like”, and comment, but not upload content on Class Story and School Story (once parental consent has been obtained by ClassDojo or their school/teacher). All content added by any user in a Class Story or School Story may be seen by other logged-in users with access to these Stories, as well as the user’s name and (for students) their ClassDojo avatar posted next to the comment or content.
Parents may not see all Feedback Points awarded by the teacher in school if the teacher [has elected](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205417235-I-Cannot-See-My-Points#web) not to show these.

Outside School Child Account, Monster Island and ClassDojo Plus Features Used Outside of School: Content uploaded or Home Points, Rewards, and Goals awarded within Premium Features while used in the Outside School Child Account or parent account is viewable by the parent and the children accessing such Premium Features within their respective accounts; the content is not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students.  The customization of the avatar by the child within Premium Features may be viewable within the child’s Student Account (and thus viewable by the child’s teacher or other students in the classroom).

For Outside School Child User’s, if the child is also utilizing certain features [approved by the child’s parent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046), such as ClassDojo Plus, or Monster Island, then other children and users may view other content as set forth [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085).

## How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information? 

We will not retain a child’s [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) for any longer than is necessary for [educational purposes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447) or legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the child’s personal information, including if a child’s parent directs us to retain certain content by electing to purchase our [Memories](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Plus-FAQ) feature. Additionally, we only keep a child’s personal information for as long as his or her Student Account or Outside School Child Account is [active](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165), unless we are required by law or the child’s school (for Student Accounts) to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, ClassDojo operates a 2-tier student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just users under 13) information (**“2-Tier Student Data Protection Policy”**):

1. **One year deletion policy for Feedback Points:**
 To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long students’ [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) given in the classroom are retained. For all students, Feedback Points older than 12 months are automatically deleted. This means Feedback Points cannot exist long-term. Teachers can also delete Feedback Points at any time. For more information on Home Points, please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732).

2. **Deleting inactive Student Accounts:**
If a student’s Student Account is [inactive](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student, added content to a student’s portfolio, or messaged with the student’s parent(s), and neither the parent(s) nor the student has logged into their accounts), ClassDojo will automatically delete the Student Account. Learn more about how we delete Student Accounts [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165). Please note that certain content 1) within a Student Account or student portfolio (uploaded by the student, teacher, or parent), such as photos, videos, Student Activity Responses or Portfolio Comments, or 2) uploaded by a teacher, school leader, parent, or student through Class Story or School Story may be kept after deletion of a Student Account as we are required to retain these at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of “education records” under FERPA or “[Student Data](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca)” under state student privacy laws). This content may also have been selected by the student’s parent to be retained by us through the parent’s purchase of our [Memories](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Plus-FAQ) feature. Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319) about how to request deletion of this content. For more information on the deletion of content related to our Premium Features or Outside School Child Accounts (and not school-based Student Accounts or content), please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732).

Additionally, we protect students with our industry-leading 2-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we automatically delete their [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) given in the classroom after a year, and (3) we delete Students’ Accounts if they’re [inactive](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) for more than twelve months. Please note that this does not include certain content uploaded by the teacher, parent, or student to the portfolio that may be considered an “education record” under FERPA or other state student privacy laws as we are required to retain these at the direction of the school.

## Parental Choices

**Access, Correction, and Deletion Rights**

1) If a child, with [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046), sets up their own Student Account or Outside School Child Account or a parent or guardian sets up their child’s Student Account or Outside School Child Account: 
If your child’s Student Account or Outside School Child Account was set up directly by your child (with your consent) or you as their parent or legal guardian, set up their Student Account or Outside School Child’s Account, or you allow them access to Premium Features, and you have a parent account connected to your child, you may access, review, correct, or delete any of your child’s personal information in the Service by emailing privacy@classdojo.com with the same email used to create your parent account or by contacting us [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571) once you are signed in to your parent account.

Please note, however, that any content uploaded (e.g., photos, videos, Student Activity Responses, Portfolio Comments, Class Story Comments), that is requested as part of a Student Account, class at a school, or otherwise directed by your child’s teacher or school, is retained at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of “education records” under FERPA); to correct or delete this content, please contact the appropriate official at your child’s school. If the school determines that the request should be implemented, the school may either make the change themselves or submit the request to ClassDojo by emailing privacy@classdojo.com or by contacting us [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571)

2) If your child’s Student Account was set up by your child’s school: 
If your child’s school set up their Student Account directly and obtained your consent (or chose to act as an agent and consent on your behalf) and you do not have a parent account connected to your child, please contact the appropriate official at your child’s school to access, review, correct or delete any of your child’s [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) in the Service. If the school determines that the request should be implemented, the school may either make the change themselves or submit the request to ClassDojo by emailing privacy@classdojo.com or by contacting us [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571). A parent or legal guardian who has a ClassDojo parent account and is already connected to their child (but did not set up their child’s Student Account) may at any time contact ClassDojo directly by emailing privacy@classdojo.com with the same email used to create your parent account or by contacting us [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571) once you are signed in to your parent account to access and review their child’s personal information in the Service, but correction or deletion requests should still be made to the child’s school first. 

For either method described above, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner consistent with applicable law. We will need to verify your identity, for example by requiring that you provide acceptable forms of personal identification as set forth in our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037987292).

**Stop Collecting Further Personal Information**

Additionally, at any time, for Outside School Children Accounts, or Premium Features, you can refuse to permit us to collect further [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) from your child by emailing privacy@classdojo.com from the same email used to create your parent account or by contacting us [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571). Please keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question.

>Basically,
>
>We believe parents who have set up their child’s Student Account or Outside School Child Account, or allow their child access to Premium Features, should always be able to delete their child's account, request for us to delete their child’s personal information, or obtain a copy of their child's personal information. Just email us at privacy@classdojo.com from the same email used to create your parent account and we’ll be happy to help or contact us [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571) once you are signed in to your parent account. Please note, however, that certain content uploaded by your child in their Student Account (in the classroom or otherwise directed by their teacher) is retained at the direction of the school for legal compliance reasons and you will need to first contact the appropriate official at your child’s school to correct or delete this information and we will have to receive this request from the school. If your child’s teacher set up their Student Account directly, and you do not have a ClassDojo parent account, please send your request to your child’s school - we will process requests we receive from the school in a timely manner. If your child’s teacher set up their Student Account directly and you do have a ClassDojo parent account, we are happy to respond directly to your requests to access and review your child’s personal information, but you will need to contact your child’s school first for any correction or deletion requests.
