It's important to us that we keep your information safe and secure. In order to help ClassDojo provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (the “**ClassDojo Services**”), ClassDojo shares information with a few other partners, vendors, and trusted organizations (“**Service Providers**”) to process it on our behalf in accordance with our instructions, Privacy Policy, and any other appropriate confidentiality, security, or other requirements. These companies will only have access to the information they need to provide the ClassDojo Services.

You can find information on these Service Providers we work with below, including what data we share with them or they provide to us, the service they provide for ClassDojo and links to their respective privacy policies or other documents that govern how they handle the information the process on our behalf.

Like any other organization, we also use “IT” business services or internal tools such as Gmail, Google Drive, Asana, and Slack to operate our organization (“**Internal Tools**”).  These Internal Tool services may incidentally contain personal information (e.g., email address or contact handle) and we apply the Service Provider restrictions described above and have included these in a separate chart below.

There are a few vendors that we also utilize in providing (or in connection with) the ClassDojo corporate website (“**ClassDojo Website**”), but which are not utilized in logged-in areas in the ClassDojo Services, we have listed those vendors below the chart for the ClassDojo Services.

This list may change over time, and we’ll work hard to keep it up-to-date. If you have any questions, please get in touch [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
