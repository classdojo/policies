## Making Purchases
   1. **Pricing.** Pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your total price may include taxes, fees, and shipping costs, all of which you are responsible for paying. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, price and availability of any products or services are subject to change without notice, and our current prices can be found on our website or within our application. ClassDojo, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of ClassDojo’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Premium Features Terms.

   2. **Your Responsibility.** You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the purchase of any premium features or content on ClassDojo ([“Premium Features”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732)) by you or any user of your account or Payment Method (as defined below) in a timely manner with a valid Payment Method. This includes paying any governmental taxes imposed on your purchase of Premium Content, including, but not limited to, sales, use, or value added taxes.
   

   3. **Availability of Premium Content**  We make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our Premium Content, including the various resources; however, the actual performance of the resources will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such content. The inclusion of any particular Premium Content or service on our Service at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products, content or services will be available at any time.  

   4. **Extra terms** You may be presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm the transaction (such as shipping terms for tangible goods). Those additional terms will also govern that transaction.

   5. **EU Right to Cancel** If you are in the EU, you consent to the performance of this contract for your purchase, and waive any Right to Cancel provided by the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) or similar implementing regulations.

## Payment Methods
   1. **Authorization.**  You authorize ClassDojo (and our designated payment processor) to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, or financial institution account (“Payment Methods”) the full amount for all charges you incur with ClassDojo to the Payment Method you designate for the transaction. When you provide a Payment Method to us, you confirm that you have the legal right to use that Payment Method and that all the information you provide to us (or our designated payment processor) is accurate, current and complete. You also authorize us to collect and store that Payment Method, along with other related transaction information, provided however, that ClassDojo will not store any credit card account numbers directly. 

   2. **Pre-Approval.** If you pay by credit or debit card, we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount, which may be as high as the full price of your purchase. We will bill your Payment Method at the time you purchase one of our Premium Features, or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds not otherwise being immediately available to you.
   
   3. **Subscription Service.** The Premium Features may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize ClassDojo to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Subscription Service. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our website or application. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by cancelling automatic renewal of paid In App Subscriptions by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your iTunes Account settings and selecting the subscription you want to modify - learn more [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039).

   4. **Sharing** You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide during your purchase of Premium Content may be shared with ClassDojo’s payment processor(s) for the sole purpose of processing the transaction.

   5. **Failed funding** If you fund a payment by debit card and your transaction results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.  If your Payment Method fails or your account is past due, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand, (b) ClassDojo may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (c) ClassDojo reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your account with ClassDojo, including deletion of your artwork from ClassDojo.

   6. **Mobile billing** Mobile operator billing is another payment method we may have available for your convenience. If you use mobile billing as a Payment Method, you consent to the following applicable risks and other terms:

        i. By choosing the mobile billing payment method, you agree that we and your mobile operator may exchange information about you in order to facilitate completion or reversal of payments, resolution of disputes, provision of customer support, or other billing-related activity.
        
        ii. You are responsible for any charges, fees, changes to your mobile plan service or billing, alterations to your mobile device, or any other consequence that may arise out of your use of mobile billing.
        
        iii. If you use mobile billing, in addition to these Premium Features Terms, you may also be bound by certain terms and conditions or other agreements with your mobile operator.
        
        iv. If you have questions about any charges or fees that appear on your mobile phone bill, you may contact your mobile provider’s customer service division.
        
        v. Sometimes, use of mobile billing in a funding transaction may lead to charges that, for various technical reasons beyond our control, cannot be refunded to you. In these cases, we have the right, but not the obligation, to issue you a courtesy credit to your electronic value Balance.

   2. **Discontinue or Limit Premium Content.** We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any piece of Premium Content or service; to honor, or impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions on Premium Content.

   3. **Our right to cancel.** We may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these Premium Features Terms or our [Terms of Service](https://www.classdojo.com/terms/), or if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss.

## Disputes and Reversals

   1. **Customer assistance.** Subject to the ["Notices and Amendments to These Premium Features Terms" section](#notices-and-amendments-to-these-premium-features-terms) below, we provide various tools in our [HelpDesk](https://www.classdojo.com/helpdesk/) to assist you to resolve a dispute arising from a payment transaction.

   2. **Duty to notify us.** If you believe that an unauthorized or otherwise problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss. Unless you submit the claim to us within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or otherwise related to the transaction. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to such dispute, are at the discretion of ClassDojo.

   3. **Technical difficulties.** If you experience a technical failure or interruption of service that causes your funding transaction to fail, you may request that your transaction be completed at a later time.
