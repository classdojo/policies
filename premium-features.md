## Making Purchases
   1. **Pricing** Pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your total price may include taxes, fees, and shipping costs, all of which you are responsible for paying. Descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, price and availability of any products or services are subject to change without notice, and our current prices can be found on our website within our application.  

   1. **Your Responsibility**  You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the purchase of any premium features or content on ClassDojo ([“Premium Features”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732)) by you or any user of your account or Payment Method (as defined below) in a timely manner with a valid Payment Method.  This includes paying any governmental taxes imposed on your purchase of Premium Content, including, but not limited to, sales, use, or value added taxes. Additionally, it is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any Premium Content. By purchasing Premium Content, you represent that the Premium Content ordered will be used only in a lawful manner. 

   1. **Availability of Premium Content**  We make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our Premium Content, including the various resources; however, the actual performance of the resources will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such content. The inclusion of any particular Premium Content or service on our Service at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products, content or services will be available at any time.  

   1. **Extra terms** You may be presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm the transaction (such as shipping terms for tangible goods). Those additional terms will also govern that transaction.

   1. **EU Right to Cancel** If you are in the EU, you consent to the performance of this contract for your purchase, and waive any Right to Cancel provided by the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) or similar implementing regulations.

## Payment Methods
   1. **Authority**  You authorize ClassDojo (and our designated payment processor) to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, or financial institution account ([“Premium Features”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732)) the full amount for all charges you incur with ClassDojo to the Payment Method you designate for the transaction. When you provide a Payment Method to us, you confirm that you have the legal right to use that Payment Method and that all the information you provide to us (or our designated payment processor) is accurate, current and complete. You also authorize us to collect and store that Payment Method, along with other related transaction information, provided however, that ClassDojo will not store any credit card account numbers directly. 

   1. **Authorization** If you pay by credit or debit card, we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount, which may be as high as the full price of your purchase. We will bill your Payment Method at the time you purchase one of our Premium Features, or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds not otherwise being immediately available to you. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method.

   1. **Sharing** You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide during your purchase of Premium Content may be shared by ClassDojo with companies who work on ClassDojo's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to ClassDojo and servicing your account. 

   1. **Failed funding** If you fund a payment by debit card and your transaction results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.  If your Payment Method fails or your account is past due, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand, (b) ClassDojo may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (c) ClassDojo reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your account with ClassDojo, including deletion of your artwork from ClassDojo.

   1. **Mobile billing** Mobile operator billing is another payment method we have made available for your convenience. If you use mobile billing as a Payment Method, you consent to the following applicable risks and other terms:

        1. By choosing the mobile billing payment method, you agree that we and your mobile operator may exchange information about you in order to facilitate completion or reversal of payments, resolution of disputes, provision of customer support, or other billing-related activity.
        
        1. You are responsible for any charges, fees, changes to your mobile plan service or billing, alterations to your mobile device, or any other consequence that may arise out of your use of mobile billing.
        
        1. If you use mobile billing, you are bound not only by these Payment Terms, but also by the terms and conditions of your mobile operator.
        
        1. If you have questions about any charges or fees that appear on your mobile phone bill, you may contact your mobile provider’s customer service division.
        
        1. Sometimes, use of mobile billing in a funding transaction may lead to charges that, for various technical reasons beyond our control, cannot be refunded to you. In these cases, we have the right, but not the obligation, to issue you a courtesy credit to your electronic value Balance.

   1. **Payment limitations** In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may place a delay on a payment for a period of time, or limit funding instruments for a transaction, or limit your ability to make a purchase, or deactivate your account.

   1. **Sharing of information** In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may contact your funding instrument issuer, law enforcement, or affected third parties (including other users) and share details of any payments you are associated with, if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or a violation of law.

   1. **Abandoned Property** If you leave a balance unused for the period of time set forth by your state, country, or other governing body in its unclaimed property laws, or if you delete your account and leave a Balance, or if we deactivate your account and you do not meet any conditions necessary to reinstate it within six (6) months, we may process your Balance in accordance with our legal obligations, including by submitting funds associated with your Balance to the appropriate governing body as required by law.

## Disputes and Reversals

   1. **Customer assistance** Subject to Sections 4.2, and 4.3 below, we provide various tools in our [HelpDesk](https://www.classdojo.com/helpdesk/) to assist you to resolve a dispute arising from a payment transaction.

   1. **Duty to notify us** If you believe that an unauthorized or otherwise problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately, so that we may take action to prevent financial loss. Unless you submit the claim to us within 30 days after the charge, you will have waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims against us arising out of or otherwise related to the transaction. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to such dispute, are at the discretion of ClassDojo.

   1. **Technical difficulties** If you experience a technical failure or interruption of service that causes your funding transaction to fail, you may request that your transaction be completed at a later time.
