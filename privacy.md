### Privacy Policy Highlights

Last updated: January 28th, 2022. You can see past versions of this policy [here](https://github.com/classdojo/policies/blob/master/privacy.md) on Github.

We believe you should always know what data we collect from you, how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower users to make the best decisions about the information that they share with us. In fact, we made a [short video](https://youtu.be/rI0s72R5f6c) for students that highlights the most important details in our Privacy Policy that they should know about. We offer a [Student Data Privacy Addendum](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2021-05-classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf), an agreement we enter into with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to [Student Data](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca) that we collect or receive.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the ClassDojo Services (defined below) and does not apply to the informational website located at [https://www.classdojo.com](https://www.classdojo.com) (the “ClassDojo Website”). The ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy is located [here](https://www.classdojo.com/website-privacy).

You should read this policy in [full](#classdojo-privacy-policy), but here are a few key points:

**Personal Information We Collect**: For the complete rundown, please see [this page](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) where we detail the [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.  

We also have [Online Tracking Technologies Policy](https://www.classdojo.com/cookies-policy/). You can also find more details [below](#what-information-does-classdojo-collect).

**How We Use the Information We Collect**: We use the [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) we collect from students (or about students from teachers and parents) to provide and improve the Service, for [educational purposes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447), security, and safety purposes, or as allowed by law. We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Service.  See [here](#how-does-classdojo-protect-children-s-personal-information-) for more information on our use of information collected from students and children using the service not connected to a school or classroom (“Outside School Child User”), including for educational and other learning activities at home through certain premium features, [“Premium Features”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732).
For additional information regarding our use of information collected from teachers, parents, and [school leaders](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207813176), see [here](#how-does-classdojo-use-the-information-it-collects-).

**Data Retention**: We will not retain student [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) for any longer than is necessary for [educational purposes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447) and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information. 

We protect students with our industry-leading 2-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: 
we automatically delete their [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) awarded in school after a year, and
we delete Students’ Accounts if they’re [inactive](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) for more than twelve months. 

Some content within a student account utilized in school or for [educational purposes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447) connected to a school or classroom (“Student Account”) will be kept after deletion of the account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of “education records” under the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/TeacherResources/FERPAPrimer/FERPAPrimer.pdf) or [“Student Data”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca) under state student privacy laws) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school. This can include content uploaded by a student, teacher, school leader, or parent. 

We store non-student user [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d), including content uploaded by Outside School Child Users, for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Service to you and others. For non-student users (as well as Outside School Child Users), personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is [deleted](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319) or until we no longer need the data to provide the Service, whichever occurs first. 

**What Children’s Information is Shown Publicly?** No Student’s Account, or Outside School Child User’s account (“Outside School Child Account”), profile, or [portfolio](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732-What-is-ClassDojo-Portfolios-and-How-Does-it-Work-) is made available or visible to the general public through ClassDojo.  For a list of what logged in student users and Outside School Child User’s information can be viewed by other logged-in ClassDojo users, please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085
). 

**We Never Sell Personal Information**: We will never [sell](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_ac14c75d-d951-44ea-9140-eef33ca14bee) or rent your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) or non-personal information. We will only share or disclose personal information as set forth in the Privacy Policy, such as with a limited set of [third-party service providers](https://www.classdojo.com/third-party-service-providers/) necessary to provide or develop our Services (such as database hosting) or as required by law, and we will be transparent about who these service providers are. 

We will contractually require that these service providers process personal information in accordance with our instructions and consistent with this Privacy Policy. We ensure that these service providers employ reasonable and comprehensive data protection and security protocols. See here for more details.

We make clear commitments, consistent with our obligations under the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/), regarding how we handle student data in the event of a change to our organization (such as a merger) where personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred or acquired.  Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Privacy Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).  Please see [here](#change-of-control-) for more details.

**We never use student information for behaviorally targeted or third-party advertising**: Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for [third-party advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_6fb13f0c-b840-412f-9956-2a519005384d). We also do not place any third-party advertisements in student logged-in areas of the Service. Additionally, personal information collected from students is **never** used for [behaviorally-targeted advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#BehaviorallyTargetedAdvertising) to students by us or any third-party. We may present contextually relevant educational content (not using student personal information) for either our own products (e.g., Premium Features) or third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to a student (e.g., our co-created content with [Yale University on Mindfulness](https://ideas.classdojo.com/b/mindfulness), and Heart of a Champion series) or Outside School Child User.

**You own your data**: We don’t own any content or information you provide or we receive - you (students, parents, and/or schools) will own your content and information.

**Security and Privacy by Design and Default**: We use security industry best practices to protect personal information, including using encryption and other security safeguards to protect personal information. We design products with security and privacy in mind from day one.  See [here](#how-does-classdojo-protect-and-secure-my-information-) for more information as well as our [Security Whitepaper](https://www.classdojo.com/security/) and [Privacy Center](https://www.classdojo.com/privacycenter/).

**Transparency and Choice**: We will be transparent about our practices so that you can make meaningful choices about how your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) is used. If we make a material change, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on our service or this website page and/or we will notify you by email (if you have provided an email address to us). See [here](#classdojo-s-commitments-to-providing-transparency-and-your-rights) for more information.

**Right to Access, Correction, and Deletion of Data**: We support access to, correction, and deletion of student personal information by the student or their parent or legal guardian, either by 1) assisting the school in meeting its requirements for access, correction, and deletion or by responding to requests we receive from schools, or 2) directly responding to requests from parents when the information is collected directly from a child, and ClassDojo obtains the parent’s consent (not the school’s) - such as when they are using our Premium Features or Outside School Child Account. Teachers, parents, school leaders, and other users can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com from the email used to create your account or [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571) once you are signed in to your account to access, correct, or update their personal information, or they can use the features in their account settings to do so. See [here](#classdojo-s-commitments-to-providing-transparency-and-your-rights) for more information on all user’s rights, including about your additional rights of data portability and right to object or withdraw consent.

## WHAT IS CLASSDOJO? 

ClassDojo is a communication platform that helps teachers encourage students in class and engage parents and other teachers. Teachers use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “[Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125)”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. Teachers can also post assignments using the Activities feature for students to complete on ClassDojo [(“Activities”)](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046897531-How-to-Assign-an-Activity-to-a-Group-or-Individual-Students-within-a-Class#web). They can use the ClassDojo Apps or the ClassDojo Platform - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other. Teachers can instantly message parents with text-based messages, pictures, videos, and stickers, [post assignments and Activities ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046897531-How-to-Assign-an-Activity-to-a-Group-or-Individual-Students-within-a-Class#web), and [privately message parents](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200185275-For-teachers#id-2) or send group messages. Teachers can also add posts to [Class Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103), [School Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103) and individual [Student Portfolios](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732-What-is-ClassDojo-Portfolios-and-How-Does-it-Work-).

Parents get to be a part of their child’s classroom experiences and may also [set up their child’s account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004708883-How-does-my-child-log-into-their-student-account-at-home-#web) on ClassDojo for use in school and at home. Parents may optionally purchase [Premium Features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) to help encourage their children at home. Parents can also comment on Class Stories and School Stories. Parents can only view their own children’s Feedback Points (if elected to be shown by their child’s teacher) and Portfolios, not those of any other students. Parents can also message with other parents. 

Students can have their own Student Account to view feedback given by teachers and parents, and perform additional tasks, such as [posting to their portfolio](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022857031-How-to-Post-to-a-Student-Portfolio#web), [responding to assigned Activities](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024555511-Where-are-Assigned-Portfolio-Activities-How-Can-I-Respond-#web) (“Student Activity Responses”), commenting on [Class Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415239472525) or Portfolio posts (teacher and student comments collectively “Portfolio Comments”), and [customizing their ClassDojo avatar](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202739645-Customize-Your-Monster#web).  Children may also use ClassDojo in the non-school context with their Outside School Child Account - for use with the parents and other parent-approved uses, including with certain Premium Features. 

In order to have a Student Account or Outside School Child Account created, children will need to either (1) have the Student Account created at school by their teacher (only after the teacher represents to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) which allows them to then [log in](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004688443-How-Students-can-Log-into-ClassDojo-#web) or (2) create their own account, such as with a username and password (which will require parental consent); or (3) have their parents create their Student Account or Outside School Child Account at home after we have obtained [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046). Any at-home points (“Home Points”) and content uploaded through use in an Outside School Child Account are not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students, but the customization of the monster through Premium Features may show up in the child’s Student Account and viewable in school (e.g., by teachers, school leaders, and other students).

School Leaders also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo. They can share notes, events, photos, and videos on School Story; only teachers, parents, and students connected to classes in the school can see these posts. School leaders can also create classes and events, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students, post to Class Story and Portfolios, add Portfolio Comments, message with parents, and see [Highlights](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207813176-What-can-School-Leaders-see-and-do-#web) of their school.

More information on how the Service operates is located [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200873509), and your participation and use of the Service is governed by our [Terms of Service](http://www.classdojo.com/terms) (“Terms”).

## HOW DOES CLASSDOJO PROTECT CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Please see our Children’s Privacy Policy [here](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy-children)

* * *

## WHAT INFORMATION DOES CLASSDOJO COLLECT?

We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the Service (described below under “[Information you provide to us](#information-you-provide-to-us)”) and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under “[Information collected automatically](#information-collected-automatically)”). We may also receive information about you from third-party sources (as described below under “[Information Received from Third-Party Sources”](#information-received-from-third-party-sources)). The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, school leader, parent, student or Outside School Child User and how they use ClassDojo (e.g., if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).  We have also created [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.

>Basically,

ClassDojo asks for some information directly from teachers, school leaders, parents, Outside School Child Users and students (such as account information), and also collects some information automatically (such as crash reports when errors occur) in order to provide you with the best possible ClassDojo experience.  Please see [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.

* * *

### Information You Provide To Us

We ask for and collect the following [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) about you when you use the Service. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services.

There are currently five categories of users on our Service: teachers, school leaders, parents, students, and Outside School Child Users who use the Services outside of school, including with our Premium Features. Additionally, as a non-logged-in visitor to the ClassDojo Website, you may provide personal information to us as set forth in our separate [ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/website-privacy). We describe the information collected from students and Outside School Child Users in the “How We Protect Children’s Personal Information” section [above](#what-information-does-classdojo-collect); for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:

* **Account Sign-up and Profile Information:** To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password, and an optional profile photo. If a student’s teacher is creating the Student Account on behalf of the student, they will provide the student’s name, grade, and possibly date of birth. This same information is also used to create the Student Account on the parent’s behalf (the parent does not currently need to provide any additional [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) of their child if a parent is connected to the school with the unique parent code). If the parent is creating their child’s account and is not connected to their child’s school, they may provide additional information about their child (such as first and last name and date of birth). Teacher, school leader, and parent profiles may be viewed by other teachers and school leaders in the same school as well as parents connected to the school or class; however, no teacher, parent, or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.

* **School Information and Collaboration Features:** If you are a teacher or school leader, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher, School Leader, or parent, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you, including to help connect your parent account to your child’s school (e.g., our [“Find a Teacher”](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050943651-Request-to-Connect-to-Your-Child-s-Teacher#web) feature). This data is only temporarily captured and not stored beyond the initial search request for schools near the user and is not viewable by other users. By connecting you and [verifying your position](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043-What-Are-Verified-Teachers-) with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers and School Leaders within the same school (and parents of children at that school) such as adding photos, videos, and text updates on Class Story or School Story for parents, students and other [verified teachers](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043) in that school to see. Learn more about our current [collaboration features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413208601357) and what information may be collected and shared from teachers, school leaders, students and parents and who can view these stories [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/201868383).

* **Class Information:** As a teacher, you enter the grade level and the names (or nicknames/ aliases) of the students in your class. Alternatively, teachers can also upload a spreadsheet to the Service with the student’s first and last names or choose students from the [School Directory](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210560366) if they are already in a class of a verified teacher within the school. If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or school leaders in their school or outside their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class’s information, excluding parent-teacher messages which remain private between one parent and one teacher.

* **Inviting Others and Sharing Content:** As a teacher or school leader, you can [invite your students’ parents](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202794025-Invite-Parents-to-ClassDojo#web) or other teachers to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo. As a parent, school leader, or teacher, you can also invite others to join the Service or share certain content (e.g., as a parent within Premium Features) by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example, by email or SMS. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests and will also treat this as [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you from having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com.

* **Messaging and Stories:** As a teacher or school leader, you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, including through Portfolios, or send broadcast messages to all parents at once, using the [ClassDojo Messaging](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309), Class Story, and School Story features.  Additionally, as a teacher, you can send messages to other teachers and school leaders. As a parent, you can also message with your child’s teacher through ClassDojo Messaging as well as through comments on Portfolios, Class Story, and School Story posts and can also message other parents that are connected to your child’s school. As a teacher, school leader, or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging and on comments you leave on a Class Story or School Story, and if you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message.. Additionally, parents may elect to turn on a feature that allows them to know if a teacher has read their messages and may similarly receive a ‘read receipt’ telling them the teacher has read the message.  

Please be aware that by using a broadcast messaging feature, such as [Class Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103) or [School Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103), any messages, photos, videos, comments or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, students (whose parents have provided verifiable [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046) to ClassDojo (or the student’s teacher has represented they have obtained any necessary [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986), and teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a broadcast message, Class Story, or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), or if any user needs to otherwise [report any abuse](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040332952) or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at privacy@classdojo.com to remove it, subject to any photo or record being deemed an “education record” under FERPA. If a photo or video is considered an “education record” you will need to first contact your child’s school to request removal. For more information on when photos or videos are considered an “education record” please see the Department of Education’s guidance [here](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/faqs-photos-and-videos-under-ferpa). We will store messages, including those on Class Story, School Story, and Portfolios, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents. For more information on how long these are retained, please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309).
 
* **Portfolio Comments:**  Teachers can also add Portfolio Comments to their students’ portfolio content (including prior to any content being shown to the student’s parent). Once the teacher has approved the student-uploaded portfolio post, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable to the child’s parent (but may have been edited by the student or teacher prior to being shown to the parent). Prior to this approval, any Portfolio Comments between the teacher and the student can’t be viewed by the student’s parent, but any connected parent will receive a notice indicating that the Portfolio Comments feature is being utilized by their child’s teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child’s teacher. 

* **Content:** Teachers, school leaders, and parents may upload photos, videos, and other content, including content that may contain personal information and can be viewed by others, on the Service, for example, on Class Story or School Story, through Messaging and Premium Features. Learn more about what information may be collected and shared from teachers, school leaders, students, and parents and who can view these stories [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/201868383). Additionally, teachers can post [Activities on ClassDojo](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009899492-How-to-Assign-Activities-to-Students#web). Once a teacher publishes such Activities, they can be viewed by their students, other teachers connected to their class, and by other teachers that ClassDojo may share with pursuant to the [Terms of Service](https://www.classdojo.com/terms/) (unless a teacher opts-out), but they will not be viewable by the general public.. Parents can also download certain content from a Class Story or School Story or access advanced reporting and additional downloads, by purchasing our Premium Features, but must first confirm that they are giving us consent to use any content that might be deemed an “education record” or “Student Data” in this manner.  Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413226902925
) for more information.  

* **Points:**   

Feedback Points - School

As a teacher or school leader, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125), such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership. These Feedback Points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s Feedback Points can only be viewed on ClassDojo by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student’s connected parent account(s) (if the teacher [has elected](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201892729-I-Can-t-See-My-Child-s-Report) to show them to the parent), and other teachers or school leaders the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual Feedback Points). 

Home Points 

Parents are given a limited number of Home Points for use at home but can also choose to customize and award additional [Home Points ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) to their children through the [Premium Features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) functionality. These Home Points can also be used to react to activities occurring within their child’s class. The Home Points may be combined with the Feedback Points earned in school and may be used by the child at the [ClassDojo Shop](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415027230221). These Home Points are only viewable by the connected parent account(s) and the child using their student account or Outside School Children’s Account and are not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students. For all points (Home Points or Feedback Points in school) and the reports generated that show these reports, we also collect product events (e.g., the number of points given, skill, which reports are viewed, etc.).  These are collected to provide the Services, including for internal analysis on product usage and quality.  We may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending push or email notifications to the parent’s, teacher’s, or student’s device to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service. 

* **Rewards and Skills:**  Parents are given a certain set of default “rewards” that they can then edit and create within Premium Features (“[Rewards](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024317332-How-You-Can-Redeem-Home-Points-for-Your-Child#ios)”).  Additionally, within Premium Features, parents can create goals or [skills](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022742252-Add-New-Skills-for-Points-at-Home-with-ClassDojo-Plus#ios) (“Skills”). Parents can then give Home Points for a specific skill to contribute towards the Skill and, once a Skill is completed, a parent may award a Reward (and may give Rewards in connection with other activities as well).  Rewards and Skills given at home can only be accessed through the parent account or the child’s Outside School Child’s Account; teachers and other students are not able to see these Rewards or Skills or to contribute points to them.  We collect product events (e.g., the value of the Rewards or Skills, whether a parent has created a goal, the number of Rewards or Skills given, and Reward or Goal name) from the parent.  These are collected for internal analysis on product usage and quality.  We may also use it to track progress in the app, and for sending push and email notifications to a parent’s email or device to encourage them to take actions within the Service (such as creating a skill). 
* **Routines:** If a parent purchases Premium Features, they may also have access to the [Routines](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Plus-FAQ feature.  We will collect additional information, such as your child’s age, in order to suggest a routine for morning, afternoon, and evening activities for your child at home (such as “out of bed”, “mealtime”, “quiet time”).   You can then modify these to add additional skills and point values.  We collect product events (e.g. the value of the Rewards or Goals, whether a parent has created a goal, the number of Rewards or Goals given, and Reward or Goal name) from the parent.  These are collected for internal analysis on product usage and quality.  We may also use it to track progress in the app, and for sending push and email notifications to a parent’s email or device to encourage them to take actions within the Service (such as creating a goal). 
* **Purchasing Premium Features:** As a parent, when you purchase any [Premium Features](ClassDojo Plus FAQ – ClassDojo Helpdesk), you will first need to have your own parent account. You will then be required to use either your Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method to purchase the Premium Features. Prior to allowing your child (or children) access to the Premium Features within their Outside School Child Account (or if any children’s personal information, educational records or Student Data are utilized in the Premium Features that previously relied on “[school consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986)”), we will also require [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046).  Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Beyond-School-FAQ) for more information. We do not collect any credit card information directly from parents to purchase Premium Features, nor is any credit card data passed back to us from any payment method you used to purchase the Premium Features. Please see [here](https://www.classdojo.com/third-party-service-providers/) for a list of what information we receive from third-parties in connection with your payment method as well as what purchase events and analytics we track through our service providers in connection with your purchases.  These purchase events and analytics are collected for internal analysis on product usage and purchase.  We may also use it to track purchases that you did not make, and for sending push and email notifications to a parent’s email or device to encourage them to take actions within the Service (such as finalizing a purchase). Parents may also share their Premium Features subscription with other parents through their account settings. Please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027698012-How-Can-I-Share-my-Beyond-School-Subscription-#ios) for more information on sharing your Premium Features subscription. 

* **Testimonials:** We may collect certain [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) (such as your name, photo, and/or video) if you choose to give us a testimonial. We post testimonials on our Service which may contain this personal information in the testimonial.  We obtain the individual’s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request the removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.
 
* **Contact Information:** As a user of the Service, you may choose to provide us with your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d), such as a name, email address, and telephone number. Some examples include when you send us an email asking a question, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with ClassDojo to improve the Service. 
 
When you send us a message using the "Contact Us" page or via email, the email addresses and phone numbers collected are not further used to market to the individual beyond providing the services requested or responding to the requests.

Our use of the information above is described below in the section “[How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy/#how-does-classdojo-use-the-information-it-collects).” If you are using the ClassDojo App, we may ask you for certain permissions - please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422195) for more detail about those permissions. We have also prepared [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.

>Basically,

>We ask you for different types of information based on who you are (i.e., teacher, school leader, parent,  student, or Outside School Child User) and which ClassDojo features you use (e.g., sending a message between a teacher and a parent, or helping a teacher or parent join their school). We have also prepared [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.

### Information Collected Automatically 

When you use the Service, we (or our [service providers](#service-providers)) may use various technologies that automatically record or collect certain information, including personal information, from your browser or your device about the services you use and how you use them. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy. 
 
The technologies and information we automatically collect include:

* **Cookies and other similar technologies:** We (or our [service providers](#service-providers)) may use [cookies or similar technologies](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_3cee3e5e-c072-4fc2-821d-84258d56c2c4) to identify your browser or device. We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in student logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Service that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site). We don’t allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our Service (i.e. such as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but we may serve contextually relevant advertising for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g., our co-created content with [Yale University on Mindfulness](https://ideas.classdojo.com/b/mindfulness)). Please read our [Online Tracking Technologies Policy](https://www.classdojo.com/cookies-policy/) for more details, including how to modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.
 
* **[Local storage](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_efdb3ae6-8829-4e77-a8e0-b47c865fbe1b):** We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage (including HTTP cookies and HTML5) and application data caches. 

Like many services, ClassDojo (or our service providers) uses both local storage and cookies and other similar technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our users, understand your engagement with the Service, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences. Please read our [Online Tracking Technologies Policy](https://www.classdojo.com/cookies-policy/) for more details.
 
* **Device information:** We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version and settings, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers. We may also collect device event information such as crashes, system activity, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them.

* **Mobile application information:** Certain mobile applications or “apps” include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the ClassDojo App, when you open the application, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help us debug and improve the ClassDojo App.
 
* **Server log information:** Like most online services, when you use our Service we automatically collect and store certain information in our [server logs](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#ServerLogData). Examples include things like:

  * Telephone log information like your phone number and SMS routing information

 * [IP address](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#IPAddress)
 
* Details of how you used our Service, such as your activity on the Service (including product event data used to track progress or user activity), and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Service (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show)

This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular and to send notifications to a device (such as push notifications if the user opted in) to encourage the user to finish an activity or start the next activity. We may use your IP address and share it with third parties to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Service, to enhance the Services based on usage pattern data and, for analytics and for advertising. Third party sharing of IP address information for analytics and advertising is not allowed for student and Outside School Child Users.

* **Location information:** When you use our Service, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example, based on your IP address. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we request precise geolocation information (“precise” meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher or parent is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We **never** request precise geolocation data from students or Outside School Child Users. From all users, if they upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone's camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo’s own application camera, we collect what the device sends us. If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file - e.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data). We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the parent in Messaging).  If a user accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device’s own camera roll).

We will not store or track your precise device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geolocation data with third-parties, other than our [service providers](#service-providers) as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.

* **Cross-device collection:** To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using, such as with our syncing technology, [DojoCast](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003775946-DojoCast-Syncing-Toolkit-and-Your-Computer#ios). We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.

>Basically,
>
>We collect some information from you automatically (and additionally use [cookies](https://www.classdojo.com/cookies-policy/) and other similar technologies to collect information) so that we know when things go wrong, or to help us understand what parts of ClassDojo need some improvement. If we need to request street-level (“precise”) geolocation data from you as a teacher, school leader, or parent, we’ll ask for your explicit, opt-in consent. We never request precise geolocation data from students.

* * *

### Information Received from Third Party Sources 

We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) that may be provided to us. If we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading “[Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information](Privacy Policy 2021 DRAFT)”. Local law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. We do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties.  Please see [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.

>Basically,

>We may collect some information from third-party sources, such as SurveyMonkey when we send questionnaires to teachers and parents. That information will be handled under this Privacy Policy. Please see [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.

## HOW DOES CLASSDOJO USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?

First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo does not [sell](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_ac14c75d-d951-44ea-9140-eef33ca14bee) or rent any of your, or your child’s, [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. [Third-party advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_6fb13f0c-b840-412f-9956-2a519005384d) is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to ClassDojo and personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). We may serve [contextually relevant advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_f3f313ab-9399-4e01-b840-1bba5756fab2) for third-party products and services that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g., our co-created content with [Yale University on Mindfulness](https://ideas.classdojo.com/b/mindfulness)).

We use your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Our use of information collected from students and Outside School Child Users using the Service  is set forth above in the section [“How Does Classdojo Protect Children’s Personal Information?”](#how-does-classdojo-protect-children’s-personal-information?) . More specifically, this information collected (from non-students and non-Outside School Child Users) is used to:

## WILL CLASSDOJO SHARE ANY INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?

ClassDojo **does not [sell](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_ac14c75d-d951-44ea-9140-eef33ca14bee) or rent** your (or your child’s) [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. [Third-party advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_6fb13f0c-b840-412f-9956-2a519005384d) is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to ClassDojo and personal information collected from students is never used for [behaviorally-targeted advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#BehaviorallyTargetedAdvertising) to students (by us or third-parties). Furthermore, we do not share personal information with any third-parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy and as set forth below:

Other Users You Share and Communicate with on ClassDojo: No teacher, school leader, parent, or student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service. Furthermore, students cannot share their [account information](#information-you-provide-to-us) or portfolio with anyone on ClassDojo, outside of their parents, teachers (including those at other schools), or school leaders. If you are a teacher, school leader, or a parent, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other ClassDojo teachers, school leaders, students, or parents - for example, things like your account information, [Feedback Points](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125) awarded to students you teach (if you are a teacher or school leader) or to your children (if you are a parent) or other information you share with teachers, school leaders, or parents you are communicating with through [ClassDojo Messaging](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309), Class Story, School Story, Portfolios, or our other collaboration features. Students can also comment on Class Stories which are shared with other logged-in users who have access to that particular Class Story.

Please keep in mind that information (including personal Information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other ClassDojo users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers and school leaders you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information and we are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information or content by others.

Third-Party Integrations on our Service: When, as a teacher, school leader, student, or parent, you use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you share a [Big Ideas activity](https://ideas.classdojo.com/) on Twitter or Facebook, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality and information that you are sharing from ClassDojo. Please see [here](#third-party-services) for more information on third-party services. Please [see here](https://www.classdojo.com/third-party-service-providers/) for a list of third-party app integrations on our Service and the ClassDojo Website.

Service Providers: We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf. These service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. We may also authorize these third-party companies to collect information on our behalf. These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed. Additionally, these partners and service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see [here](https://www.classdojo.com/third-party-service-providers/) for a list of the third-parties we work with to provide the Service and the ClassDojo Website.

Social Media Platforms: Where permissible according to applicable law, we may share certain limited personal information with social media platforms (such as Google or Facebook) and other websites, applications or partners, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise market and advertise our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students). These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest. These social media platforms with which we may share your personal information are not controlled or supervised by ClassDojo. Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform processes your personal information should be directed to such provider.

Analytics Services: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. A current list of analytics providers that we use is located [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203732189).

Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information:  We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other [de-identified](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#Deidentified) or non-personally identifiable information (such as statistics about visitors, traffic and usage patterns), including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how ClassDojo is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo. Any aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any personal information.

Legal Requirements:  We may disclose information, including personal information, if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.classdojo.com/terms/) or other agreements.  This includes, without limitation, responding to law enforcement and government requests. Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon ClassDojo, or its users. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.

Fraud and Security Protection:  We may share information to assist with security operations for scheduled penetration testing, auditing, and continuous improvement of our security practices, including without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. Authorized parties of the information would comply with our current privacy and security policies.

Sharing with ClassDojo Companies:  Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Change of control: The [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/) requires us (and all pledgers) to commit to how we handle data in the event of a change to our organizations such that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, or in any other situation where [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party. Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, if any, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company. We may also make information, including personal information, available to a potential investor or purchaser (or their advisors) in advance of any such transaction completion. 

In the unlikely event that ClassDojo goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d), and will not [sell](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_ac14c75d-d951-44ea-9140-eef33ca14bee) it to any third-party. For more information on our practices regarding your data if we go out of business, please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/201166546).

With your consent:  Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) for any purpose unless you consent to it.

## HOW DOES CLASSDOJO PROTECT AND SECURE MY INFORMATION?

Your ClassDojo account is protected by a password or a QR code. You can help us protect against unauthorized access to your account by keeping your password or QR code secret at all times. 
The security of your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) is important to us. We work hard to protect our community, and we maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of, or access to personal information. In particular:

* Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure
 
* We perform application security testing; penetration testing; conduct risk assessments; and monitor compliance with security policies
 
* We periodically review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems
 
* Whenever we develop new features, we do in a manner  to keep your personal information safe
 
* When you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS) by default
 
* ClassDojo’s databases where we store your personal information is encrypted at rest, which converts all personal information stored in the database to an unintelligible form. 
 
* We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing
 
* The Service is hosted on servers at a [third-party facility](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203732189), with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures. For example, personal information is stored on a server equipped with industry-standard firewalls. In addition, the hosting facility provides a 24x7 security system, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and locked cage areas.
 
* We automatically delete [inactive student accounts](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165) after a specific period of time, as per our retention policy, described in the “[How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?](#how-long-does-classdojo-keep-children-s-information)” section.
 
* We also operate a ‘bug bounty’ security program to encourage an active community of third-party security researchers to report any security bugs to us. More information on this is available by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com
 
* We restrict access to personal information to authorized ClassDojo employees, agents or independent contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations

For additional information on our security practices, please see our [Security Whitepaper](https://www.classdojo.com/security/) and our [Privacy Center](http://www.classdojo.com/privacycenter). 
Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use, or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws and school reporting requirements) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.classdojo.com) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

>Basically,
>
>The security of your information is important to us, and we take it very seriously. We’re always adding safeguards to ensure the safety and security of ClassDojo and our community of teachers, school leaders, parents, and students. You can help us out by keeping your password and QR code secret! When you enter information anywhere on the Service or the ClassDojo Website, we encrypt the transmission of that information using SSL by default.

### Access or correct your personal information

You have the right to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within your ClassDojo account). 
 
**Managing Your Information**: If you have registered for an account on ClassDojo, you may update, correct, or delete some of your profile information or your preferences at any time by logging into your account on ClassDojo and accessing your account settings page.

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort or if more than two times a year for access rights.

## HOW LONG DOES CLASSDOJO KEEP INFORMATION ABOUT ME?

Non-Student Users:

We store your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) for as long as it is necessary to provide the Service to you and others, including those described above.  We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information being processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information, whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitations).   

Personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services, in which case we will delete prior to you deleting your account. Please note that we may have to retain some information after your account is closed, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms. You can, of course, [delete your account]( #how-can-i-delete-my-account-) at any time. Additionally, please note that even if your account is deleted, messages sent between teachers and parents are retained to assist schools with various recordkeeping or compliance obligations. Additionally, some content uploaded by a teacher, school leader, or parent, including photos, videos, and Portfolio Comments on Messaging, Portfolios, Class Story, or School Story, are retained at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of “education records” under FERPA or “Student Data” under various state student privacy laws) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school. For more details, please read “What happens when I delete my account?” in our [FAQs](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319).

Student Users and Outside School Child Users:

Please see the “[How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?](Children's Section PP 10 11 21.docx)” for details on how long we retain data for student users.

>Basically,
>
>We keep teacher, school leader, and parent personal information until your account is deleted, or until we no longer need it to provide you with the Service. We only keep student personal information for as long as the student’s account is [active](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165), unless we are required by law or the student’s school to retain it, or need it to protect the safety of our users. Additionally, for students, we have our 2-Tier Student Data Protection Policy that states how we delete students’ information after some time. Note that some content may be kept after an account (student, parent, or teacher) is deleted for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of “education records” under FERPA).

These communications may include, but are not limited to, social media updates, SMS/MMS messages, push and in-app notifications, email, and postal mail. If you have an account with us, we’ll also use your email address to contact you for customer service purposes, or for any legal matters that arise in the course of business.

If they would prefer not to receive our communications, they may opt-out using the “Unsubscribe” or “STOP” instructions contained in those communications. If, as a parent/legal guardian of a student, you provided an email address or phone number to your child’s school, ClassDojo, at the direction of the school, may send an invitation to join ClassDojo via the email or phone number your student’s teacher provided ClassDojo. The invitation may be sent via email or SMS/MMS text message. If, as a parent/legal guardian, you provide your telephone number to your child’s school, you are consenting to ClassDojo (on behalf of and at the direction of your child’s school) sending informational text messages closely related to the school’s mission.

## THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATION SERVICES

If you decide to register for a ClassDojo account through an authentication service, such as Google Login (“Authentication Service”), ClassDojo may collect [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) that is already associated with your account connected to the Authentication Service. If you choose to provide such information during registration, you are giving ClassDojo the permission to store and use such information already associated with your Authentication Service in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. The current list of Authentication Services that we use is listed [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203732189). Please note, that when using an Authentication Service for registering a student (or if a student is directly using their own Authentication Service), ClassDojo will not request more information from the Authentication Service than name and email address unless specifically requested or chosen to be passed by the teacher or school to ClassDojo. We will only use the email collected from student users for the purposes of login and account management. The Authentication Service may collect certain other information from you in your use of that particular service (such as G-Suite for Education). 
You may revoke ClassDojo’s access to your account on any Authentication Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Authentication Service. You should check your privacy settings on each Authentication Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Authentication Service. Please review each Authentication Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service. Your use of Authentication Service is subject to the applicable third-party terms and privacy policies. Please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571) for more information on what we collect through the use of Authentication Services and how we use that information.

You can revoke our access to your account on this authentication service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account settings of the authentication service.

## THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The Service may contain links to websites, applications, services, or other content provided by third-parties (e.g., video players). Your use of these features may result in the collection, processing and sharing of information about you, depending on the features.  Any information, including [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d), you choose to provide or that is collected by these third-parties is subject to that third-party’s policies governing privacy and security and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.

These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you, including if you view a video through an embedded video player which is played off our Service, but may appear to still be playing on our Service. The fact that we link to a website or other third-party content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third-party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We are not responsible for the content, features, privacy and security practices and policies of any third-parties. We encourage you to learn about third-parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with personal information.

>Basically,

>Links to other websites and services as well as embedded video players may be found within the Service — this Privacy Policy does not apply to those.

## HOW WILL CLASSDOJO NOTIFY ME OF CHANGES TO THIS POLICY?

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy as our business practices and legal requirements evolve or to further protect our users. You can see when the last update was by looking at the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We won’t reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. If we make any significant changes, we’ll provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service and/or notifying you by email (using the email address you provided), so you can review and make sure you know about them.

In addition, if we ever make material changes to the types of [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents in order to obtain [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046) or notice for those new practices and provide schools with the necessary information about these changes where they have obtained [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) (or acted as the agent of the parent and provided consent on their behalf).

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Service. If you don’t agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account (although we’ll be sad to see you go!). By continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy.

>Basically,
>
>We will let you know by email and/or on our website when we make significant changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to the types of [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents, or ask for their [consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046) and provide schools with the necessary information about these changes where they have obtained [parental consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) (or acted as the agent of the parent and consent on their behalf).

## IS CLASSDOJO A CONTROLLER?

ClassDojo processes personal information both as a Processor and as a Controller, as defined in the GDPR and/or used under the CCPA: 
 
When teachers, school leaders, and parents enter information directly into our Service (such as registering for an account), or when parents or students use our Premium Features outside of the school context, ClassDojo will generally be the Controller for the user data, as outlined above in “[What information does ClassDojo collect?](#what-information-does-classdojo-collect)” section. However, in certain circumstances, where requested by the student’s school, ClassDojo will be the Processor (or service provider as defined under CCPA), including of Student Data, and will process such data only at the direction and control of the school.  Additionally, ClassDojo will only delete records per the school’s specific instructions and will request that you make any requests for access, correction or deletion of personal information through the school. ClassDojo will respond to such requests when received from the school. Please see ClassDojo’s policy on [data retention and deletion](#how-long-does-classdojo-keep-information-about-me-).

## WHAT IF I’M NOT IN THE U.S.?

ClassDojo is hosted and operated in the United States. If you use the Service from the European Union or the United Kingdom, or any other region with laws governing data collection, protection and use that may differ from United States law, please note that you may be transferring your personal information outside of those jurisdictions to the United States. Where we transfer, store and process your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) outside of the United Kingdom, European Union, or EEA, we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects based on the adequacy of the receiving country’s data protection laws, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses (where we process data as a Processor for schools) or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or other applicable regulator.  For more information on these safeguards, please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053338371-Transfer-of-Personal-Data-to-the-U-S-).
 
By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, including to the United States, and to the storage of your personal information in the United States, for the purpose of hosting, using and processing the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You further acknowledge that these countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country from which you provided your personal information, and that ClassDojo may be compelled to disclose your personal information to U.S. authorities. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us as described in the “Contacting ClassDojo” section below.

### EU – U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD AND SWISS – U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD

ClassDojo complies with the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom and/or Switzerland as applicable to the United States in reliance on the Privacy Shield. ClassDojo has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov).

ClassDojo is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and subsequently transfers to third-parties acting as an agent on its behalf. ClassDojo complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, ClassDojo is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. In certain situations, ClassDojo may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider, free of charge [here](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

As of July 16, 2020, we no longer rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the UK to the U.S, but continue to uphold our obligations and responsibilities for data transferred prior to this date under the Privacy Shield.  Additionally, even though we no longer rely on the Privacy Shield as a transfer mechanism from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK to the U.S., we have chosen to continue to comply with the Privacy Shield and its commitments to demonstrate our continued commitment to privacy.

## CALIFORNIA PRIVACY DISCLOSURES

**Your Rights and Choices:**  

If you are a California resident you have the right to request that ClassDojo disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) over the past twelve (12) months.  Please see [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.

California consumers also have specific rights of access, deletion and data portability regarding their [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) under the CCPA. If you are a California resident you have the right to request that ClassDojo provide the specific pieces of information that we have collected about you. You also have the right to request deletion of your personal information collected or maintained by ClassDojo.  We provide these same rights to all users.  Please see the [ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Your Rights] Section (#classdojo-s-commitments-to-providing-transparency-and-your-rights) for more detail on how to exercise these rights, including how we will verify requests. If you are a California resident, you may also designate a natural person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf to exercise these rights. 

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under CCPA.  Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.  
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.  Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will be reasonably related to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.  Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

>Basically,
>
>If you are a California resident, the CCPA affords you certain rights of access, deletion and data portability - which we also extend to all users.  Please see the [ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Your Rights] Section (#classdojo-s-commitments-to-providing-transparency-and-your-rights) for more detail on how to exercise these rights, including how we will verify requests.  We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA. Additionally, if you are a California resident you are entitled to certain disclosures regarding our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months -  Please see [this chart](https://www.classdojo.com/transparency/) for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.

**Do Not Sell:**  As stated throughout this Privacy Policy, ClassDojo **does not [sel](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_ac14c75d-d951-44ea-9140-eef33ca14bee)l** [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) of any ClassDojo Services user to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Furthermore, we do not share or disclose personal information with any third-parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy and as set forth here.  

**Do Not Track:** Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT. For more information on “do not track,” please visit [www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org).

Third-parties that have content embedded on the Service, such as a social feature, or an embedded video player, may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited the Service from a certain IP address. Third-parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from the Service unless you provide it to them directly.

>Basically,

>The ClassDojo Service does not track our users over time across third-party websites to provide [behaviorally-targeted advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#BehaviorallyTargetedAdvertising) and thus does not respond to Do Not Track signals.


**Notice for Minors (Users under 18)** 

If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a child using ClassDojo under the age of 18 residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you (the minor) have publicly posted on our Service. Currently, we do not allow minors to post content to share publicly.  Minors can share content or comment on Class Stories which can only be seen by users with access to that particular class - such as other students, parents, and teachers.  Additionally, ClassDojo offers various [interactive features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085) where minors can interact directly with each other.  Minors (or the minor’s parents if under 13) have the option to delete [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) associated with their user accounts or content that they upload through their student account on their portfolio on Class Stories or content they may share with other children. If you are a minor, or the parent of a minor under 13, and would like to delete personal information associated with your account or content you uploaded through your account, please follow the directions set forth in the “[ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Your Rights](#classdojo-s-commitments-to-providing-transparency-and-your-rights)” section, which may include the need to contact your school first. Although we offer deletion capabilities on our Service, you should be aware that the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the Service, as there may be [de-identified](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#Deidentified) or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form. Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain at the direction of the school or under applicable laws.

>Basically,

>If you are a minor or parent of a minor, you may delete information per the "[How can I delete my account?](#how-can-i-delete-my-account-)" section.
