# ClassDojo Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 19, 2017

ClassDojo’s mission is to give teachers, school leaders, parents, and students the power to create incredible classrooms. We’re humbled that millions of people like you trust ClassDojo to do that every day. Keeping this trust through your privacy and safety is incredibly important to us.

This Privacy Policy explains: 
> - What information ClassDojo collects from you (and why we collect it),
> - How we use and share that information,
> - The choices you have, including how to access, update and delete your information.

This policy applies to all products and services offered by Class Twist, Inc. (“ClassDojo,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and our subsidiaries or affiliates). 

Our Privacy Policy is designed to provide transparency into our privacy practices and principles. We’ve done our best to write this policy in simple, clear terms, but if you’re not familiar with terms like personal information, cookies, IP address, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms. We’ve also added a column on the right that provides short explanations of the legal language in plain English (it starts with ‘Basically...’) to help even more with understanding, but it isn’t legally binding.

You can see past versions of this policy [here](https://github.com/classdojo/policies/blob/master/privacy.md) on Github.

## What is ClassDojo?

ClassDojo is a communication platform that helps teachers encourage students in class and engage parents. In the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “feedback points”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. They use the ClassDojo App or the ClassDojo Website - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other. Beyond the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to engage families. Teachers can instantly message parents with text-based messages, pictures, videos, and stickers, and also add posts to Class Story and School Story - a private feed of moments from the classroom and school that only students, parents, “verified teachers,” and school leaders can see. Additionally, students can view their own feedback points and upload content to their own Student Story - a private feed of content that only the student, their teacher, or the student’s parents can see.

Parents access and set up an account on ClassDojo using a unique parent code provided by their child’s teacher, or through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique parent code. Parents can only view their own children’s feedback points and Student Story, not those of any other students. 

Students can also have their own account to view feedback given by teachers, and perform additional tasks, such as adding photos and videos of classwork to their Student Story, writing journal entries, and customizing their ClassDojo avatar - a cute monster that represents the student on ClassDojo. In order to have a student account created, students will need to either (1) have the student account created at school by their teacher (only after the teacher represents to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary parental consent); or (2) receive a unique code from their teacher to create their own account with a username and password (which will require parental consent); or (3) have their parents create their student account at home after we have obtained parental consent.
 
When a parent sets up an account for their child, they will first need a parent account. We don’t ask the child’s parent for any additional information regarding their child during the student account creation process, but link the account to the name and information provided by the child’s teacher. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we may ask the parent to provide the date of birth or age of their child, and if they are under 13, we will then seek to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to proceed with creating their child’s account. Once we have obtained parental consent, the child’s account will be set up and a QR code will be accessible on the parents device to let the child log in to their student account. Although not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students 13 and above at our discretion. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when a parent sets up their account. We will also seek to obtain parental consent if a child sets up their own account after receiving the unique code from their teacher. 

If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize student accounts within the ClassDojo App on a shared device (or any other devices) in school, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under COPPA to create the student account on behalf of the student and let students access their accounts. After doing so, if the teacher is creating the student’s account, the teacher will be able to share a QR code with their class and then  students can scan the QR code and tap their name to log in and start using their student account. Alternatively, a teacher may choose to allow students to set up their own account using the unique code provided by the teacher.  When students set up their own ClassDojo account, they create a unique username and password and will use this to access their account instead of the QR Code. In accordance with COPPA, we ask for their age, and if they are under 13, we also ask for a parent or guardian’s email address to request parental consent. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account.  Any student account (or access to a student account) created for the student by the parent, or the student’s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts). Additionally, the student’s teacher needs to approve any photo or video taken by the student in any student account (meaning parent created, student created or teacher created) before it can be shared with parents on Student Story. 

School Leaders also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo. They can share notes, photos, and videos on School Story  - only teachers, parents and students connected to classes in the school can see these posts. School Leaders can also create classes, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students and message with parents, plus see Highlights - a high-level overview of all the feedback and engagement happening within their school.

## How does ClassDojo protect children’s personal information?
Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us - we’re educators and parents ourselves, after all. This is why we’ve signed the Student Privacy Pledge and received iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor seal, signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed and approved for compliance with iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor program. COPPA protects the online privacy of children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”); for more information about COPPA and generally protecting children’s online privacy, please visit [OnGuard Online](http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online).

**What Information Does ClassDojo Collect from Children, and How Is It Used?**
ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to use our Service. Currently student accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent; (2) by the student’s teacher; or (3) by the student in the classroom if the teacher elects to provide the student with a unique code. When logging into a student account created by a parent or teacher, students do not need to provide any information beyond scanning a unique QR code provided by their teacher or by their parent and in the classroom, choosing their name from a list shown to them. If a student has created their own account, they will use the username and password they created. 

When a parent sets up an account for their child, they will first need a parent account. In order to set up a parent account, parents must first receive the unique parent code provided to their child by their child’s teacher or sent through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique parent code. We don’t ask the child’s parent for any additional information regarding their child during the student account creation, but link the account to the name and information provided by the child’s teacher. In accordance with COPPA, we may ask the parent to provide the date of birth or age of their child, and if the child is under 13, we will also then seek to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to proceed with creating their child’s account. Once we have obtained parental consent, the child’s account will be set up and a QR code will be accessible on the parents device to allow the child to log in to their student account. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when a parent sets up their account. Although not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students 13 and above at our discretion.

If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize student accounts on a shared device (or any other devices) in school, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under COPPA to create the student account on behalf of the student and let students access their accounts. After doing so, if the teacher is creating the student’s account, the teacher will be able to share a QR code with their class and then students can scan the QR code and tap their name from the list of names shown to them to log in and start using their student account. Please note that if you, as a parent, provide an email to the school when the school is obtaining parental consent, we may send an email out to you asking you to verify your child’s account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service. 

Alternatively, a teacher may choose to allow students to set up their own account using the unique code provided by the teacher. When students set up their own ClassDojo account, we ask students to provide a unique username (we advise students not to use their real names), a password and the unique code they have been given by their teacher to connect with the class.  They will use the username and password to access their account instead of the QR Code. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for the child’s age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided this way to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account.

Any student account (or access to a student account) created for the student by the parent, or the student’s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts). 

**Photos, Videos and Journal Entries** 
Once a student account is created (whether created by the student’s teacher or parent or the student themself) and parental consent is obtained, students will be able to take and upload photos, videos and write journal entries (which may contain personal information) to their account and Student Story which will be collected by ClassDojo. The Student Story can only be viewed by the student themself, the student’s parents, and the student’s teachers and school leaders. If the school or teacher elects to utilize student accounts in the classroom, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under COPPA. Additionally, the student’s teacher must approve any post made by students (whether uploaded in their student account created at home or school) before it is shared with parents on Student Story. Any content uploaded by a student in their student account created by their parent or in the classroom by their teacher or themselves will appear in the same student account (these are not three different accounts).

**Viewing Stories**
Students with student accounts may also view the Class Story and School Story, however, they will not be able to post content (such as videos or photos) to either the Class Story or School Story. Currently, students are limited to posting content to just their own Student Story. 

In addition to the information listed above, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the “Information collected automatically” section. 

We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, as required by law, or to enforce our Terms. We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third-parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, as required by law, or to protect the security of the Service or other users. Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising. Additionally, personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students by us or any third-party, and children’s personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers and advertisers.

We also receive from the child’s teacher whatever name he or she has provided for the student, and the feedback points assigned by that teacher. Teachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; they can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name and seat number).

> Basically,
> 
> ClassDojo has been certified by iKeepSafe, an FTC-approved COPPA Safe Harbor, for compliance with their COPPA Safe Harbor program. We don’t ask for or require children to provide personal information beyond that which is reasonably necessary to use ClassDojo. Information collected from students is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of behaviorally-targeted advertising, and it is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.

**Push Notifications**
ClassDojo may send push notifications to students - for example, letting them know when their weekly report is ready, or telling them about an achievement milestone they reached! We require children provide a parent’s email address before he or she can receive push notifications from ClassDojo (or have a student account previously set up on ClassDojo by their parent). We will then provide the parent with notice and provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. The device identifier for a child’s account will only be associated with other personal information once parental consent is provided. If you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer want these communications to be sent, please either turn off the push notifications on your device, or contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.

> Basically,
> 
> Before ever sending a push notification to a child, we will provide notice to parents, or obtain parental consent. Parents can always opt-out later as well.

**What Children’s Information is Visible to Others?**
No student’s account, profile, or Student Story is made available or visible to the public through ClassDojo. Only the student, the student’s parents, and the student’s teachers or School Leaders can see the student’s profile and Student Story. No child can upload content (such as a photo or video) to the Service except through their student account. This can’t happen for children without either (1) the parent providing parental consent directly to ClassDojo or (2) the child’s teacher representing to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary parental consent. No photos or videos added by a child to their student account is viewable by the general public. If a students add contents to their account in the classroom, students can’t view each other’s individual student accounts or Student Story unless they have intentionally chosen another student’s name from the list of names shown to them or viewed the camera roll locally on the device that may be saving photos and videos taken by students. Parents will still be able to view their own child’s Student Story if they have not separately created an account for their child, but only after the teacher has approved the photos or videos.

Class Story and School Story are visible by students, teachers, parents and school leaders who have logged into their accounts and are associated with that particular class or school. They are not viewable by the general public. Parents, teachers and School Leaders can add content or comments to these stories, but students can only view or like content on these stories and are only able to do this once either the school or ClassDojo has obtained parental consent, if under 13.

Teachers may share their classes, including feedback points, Student Stories, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders in their school. Please note that if the teacher chooses to display ClassDojo in their classroom, students physically present in that classroom may see other students’ names, avatars (which can be the default avatars, or avatars modified by students) and total feedback points - this is similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work. Students’ full profiles or Student Stories showing each feedback point awarded are not shown in this class view, and are therefore kept private for each student, their teacher(s), and their parents. Teachers can of course choose not to display ClassDojo this way, for example by using the ClassDojo App on their mobile devices — and many do!

> Basically,
> 
> By default, the full set of feedback and content posted to a student’s account is private to the student, their teacher(s), School Leader, and their parents. If a teacher displays the ClassDojo website in class - which is completely optional - only a student’s total points and avatar will be displayed. Parents can view all teacher-approved posts shared on their child’s Student Story, as well as every post shared on Class Story and School Story. Students can view and like, but not upload, content and comments on Class Story and School Story (once parental consent has been obtained by ClassDojo or their school/teacher).

**How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?**
We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as his or her student account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, ClassDojo operates a 3-tier student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just children’s) information (“3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy”): 

1. Minimal information: ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to use the our Service. Currently, student accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent; (2) by the student’s teacher; or (3) by the student in the classroom if the teacher elects to provide the student with a unique code. When a parent or teacher sets up a student account for the child, we link that account to any existing name and information provided by the child’s teacher and don’t specifically ask for any additional personal information regarding the child. Once we have obtained parental consent (or the teacher has confirmed to have obtained any necessary parent consent), a QR code will be generated to allow the child to log in to the student account. If accessing the student account in class, the student will select their name from a class list after scanning the QR code. If a teacher provides a unique code to a student for the student to set up their own account, we ask students to provide just the unique code given by their teacher, a username, and a password. We advise students to not use any personal information in their username. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we ask students for their age, and a parent or guardian’s email address if they are under 13 years of age so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account. The student account also allows the student the ability to upload photos and videos and write journal entries which will also appear on the student’s Student Story. The student’s teacher must approve the posts made by a student before parents can see them on Student Story. 

Beyond this information, ClassDojo does not allow students the ability to enter any additional personal information to set up a ClassDojo account. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the “Information collected automatically” section.

2. One year deletion policy for feedback points: To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long students’ feedback points are retained. For all students, feedback points older than 12 months are automatically deleted, unless the student or their parent chooses to retain them by creating their own associated account. For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2017, then unless students or parents create accounts, on January 1, 2018 any feedback points added in that class on or before January 1, 2017 would be deleted (and will continue to be deleted on an ongoing basis as each point reaches 12 months in age). This means feedback points cannot exist long-term without either being deleted automatically, or students or parents knowing about them and being able to access and delete them on their own (by deleting both the parent and student accounts entirely). Teachers can also delete feedback points at any time.

3. Deleting inactive accounts: If a student’s account is inactive for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student or messaged with the student’s parent, and neither the parent nor the student have logged into his or her account), ClassDojo will automatically delete the student account, including all student-uploaded content, personal information provided by students or collected by ClassDojo from students, as well as feedback points associated with the account that are more than 12 months old. Learn more about how we delete student accounts here. Please note that this does not include photos or videos or other information captured through Class Story or School Story which are shared with all parents and are not just part of the student account. Please see our FAQ about how to request deletion of this content.

> Basically,
> 
> We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as the account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to enforce our policies, or to ensure the security of our community. Additionally, we protect students with our industry-leading 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we collect only minimal information from students necessary to use the service, (2) we automatically delete their feedback points after a year - unless students or parents choose to save them for longer, and (3) we delete students’ accounts, including Student Stories, if they’re inactive for more than twelve months.

**Parental Choices**
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who has created a ClassDojo account and you did not receive an email seeking your consent or providing notice (as per COPPA), you can email us at privacy@classdojo.com to have that child’s account deleted.

Any parents that want copies of their children’s personal information that we may have stored can contact us either by sending an email at privacy@classdojo.com or as described in the “How can I contact ClassDojo with questions?” section below. At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children, and can request that we delete the personal information we have collected from their child by contacting us as per the “How can I contact ClassDojo with questions?” section below. Please keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question. Also remember that before we can share the information with you, or delete it per your request, we will need to verify your identity, for example by requiring that you provide acceptable forms of personal identification.

> Basically,
> 
> We believe parents should always be able to delete their child's account, request for us to delete their child’s personal information, or obtain a copy of their child's personal information. Just email us and we’ll be happy to help.

## What information does ClassDojo collect?

We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the ClassDojo Service (described below under “Information you provide to us”) and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under “Information collected automatically”). The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, school leader, parent or student (e.g. we collect minimal information from students) and how they use ClassDojo (e.g. if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).

> Basically,
> 
> ClassDojo asks for some limited information directly from teachers, school leaders, parents, and students (such as account information), and also collects some information automatically (such as crash reports when errors occur) in order to provide you with the best possible ClassDojo experience.

### Information you provide to us
There are currently four categories of users on our Service: teachers, school leaders, parents, and students. We describe the information collected from students under 13 in the section above; for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:

* **Account Sign-up and Profile Information**: To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo. Student accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent (after obtaining parental consent); (2) by the student’s teacher (after they represent that they have obtained any necessary parental consent); or (3) by the student in the classroom if the teacher elects to provide the student with a unique code. If the student’s teacher is creating the student account, they will have provided certain information, like the student’s name, about the student to ClassDojo when setting up their class that is then used to create the student account. This same information is also used to create the student account on the parent’s behalf (the parent does not currently need to provide any additional personal information of their child). If a student sets up the account, they will be asked to enter the unique code they have been given by their teacher (students are unable to sign up for the Service without this), along with a unique username and password. Per COPPA, we may also ask for the student for their age and a parent or guardian’s email address so we can seek parental consent (or notice), as appropriate. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information to create their student accounts. Teacher and school leader profiles may be viewed by other teachers and school leaders in the same school; however, no teacher, parent or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.
 
* **School Information, Collaboration Features and Content**: If you are a teacher or school leader, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher or school leader, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you. By connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers and school leaders within the same school such as adding photos, videos, and text updates on Class Story or School Story for parents, students and other verified teachers in that school to see. Learn more about our current collaboration features and what information may be collected and shared from teachers, school leaders, students and parents and who can view these stories here.

* **Class Information**: As a teacher you’ll need to enter the class year (e.g., first grade) and the names of the students in your class. It is the teacher’s choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter John S or John Smith. Alternatively, teachers can also upload a spreadsheet to the Service with the student’s first and last names. If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or School Leaders in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class’s information.

* **Inviting Others**: As a teacher or school leader, you can invite your students’ parents to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo. As a parent, school leader, or teacher you can also invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example by email, SMS, or sharing via Facebook or Twitter. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com.
 
* **Feedback points**: As a teacher or school leader, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using feedback points, such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership. These feedback points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s feedback points can only be viewed on ClassDojo by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student’s parents, and other teachers or school leaders the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual feedback points).

* **Messaging**: As a teacher or school leader, you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, including through Student Story, or send broadcast messages to all parents at once, using the ClassDojo Messaging, Student Story, Class Story, and School Story features. As a parent, you can also message with your child’s teacher through ClassDojo Messaging as well as through comments on Student Story, Class Story, and School Story posts. As a teacher, school leader, or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging, and if you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message. Please be aware that by using a broadcast messaging feature, such as Class Story or School Story, any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, students (whose parents have provided verifiable parental consent to ClassDojo (or the student’s teacher has represented they have obtained any necessary parental consent)), and teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a broadcast message, Class Story, or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), the student or parent can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com to remove it. We will store messages, including those on Class Story and School Story, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents. For more information on how long these are retained, please see our FAQ.

* **Contact Information**: When you choose to provide us with your personal information through the Service in some other manner (e.g., when you send us an email asking a question, submit a support request, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with ClassDojo to improve the Service).

Our use of the information above is described below in the section “How Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects”. If you are using the ClassDojo App, we may ask you for certain permissions - please click here for more detail about those permissions.

> Basically,
> 
> We ask you for different types of information based on who you are (i.e., teacher, school leader, parent, and student) and which ClassDojo features you use (e.g., sending a message between a teacher and a parent, or helping a teacher join their school).

### Information collected automatically
Like most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.

The technologies and information we automatically collect include:

**Cookies and other similar technologies**
We (or our service providers) may use cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in student logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our services that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g. if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site). We don’t allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our service (i.e. such as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but we may serve contextually relevant advertising for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g. our co-created content with Yale University on Mindfulness).


**Local storage** We may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. 

Like many services, ClassDojo uses these technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information, understand your engagement with the ClassDojo Website, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.

Please read our Online Tracking Technologies Policy for more details on local storage and cookies and similar technologies including how to remove or modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.

**Device information**
We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them.

**Mobile application information:**
Certain mobile applications or “apps” include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the ClassDojo App, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.  Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help with “debugging” and for improvement of the ClassDojo App.

**Server log information**
Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. Examples include things like:

* Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the ClassDojo Website or ClassDojo App (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show)
* Telephony log information like your phone number and SMS routing information
* IP Address
* Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL

This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular.
 
**Location information**
When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we collect precise geolocation information (“precise” meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We **do not** collect precise geolocation data from students. We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geo-location data with third-parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.

**Cross-device collection**
To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using our syncing technology, DojoCast. With DojoCast, ClassDojo is able to provide a seamless experience across multiple devices and browsers without collecting or processing any additional identifying personal data. 

> Basically,
> 
> We collect some information from you automatically (and additionally use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information) so that we know when things go wrong, or to help us understand what parts of ClassDojo need some improvement. If we need to collect street-level (“precise”) geolocation data from you as a teacher, school leader, or parent, we’ll ask for your explicit, opt-in consent. We do not collect precise geolocation data from students.

### Information received from third-party sources
We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically.  Local law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. This may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us. If we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading “Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information”.

> Basically,
> 
> We may collect some information from third-party sources, such as SurveyMonkey when we send questionnaires to teachers and parents. That information will be handled under this Privacy Policy.

## How does ClassDojo use the information it collects?

First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo does not sell or rent any of your, or your child’s, personal information to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Third-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to ClassDojo and personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). We use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best ClassDojo experience. More specifically, this information is used to:
 
* Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features
* Respond to your emails, submissions, questions, requests for information or customer support
* Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it
* Send you information about features on our Service or changes to our policies and Service
* Provide parents and teachers information about events, announcements, offers, promotions, products, including third-party products, and services we think will be of interest to you
* Notify and contact contest and sweepstakes entrants
* Most crucially, to protect our community by making sure the Service remains safe and secure

We use automatically collected information (described in the “Information collected automatically” section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy. To learn more about how we use your information for personalization and tracking, please see the Online Tracking Technologies Policy.

> Basically,
> 
> ClassDojo doesn’t sell or rent your information to third-parties, we don’t permit third-party advertising on ClassDojo, and personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students. We use your information to provide and personalize the Service to you, optimize and improve our Service, communicate with you about our Service, and for security and safety reasons.
 

Will ClassDojo Share Any Information it Collects?

First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo does not sell or rent your (or your child’s) personal information to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes. Third-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to ClassDojo and personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). Furthermore, we do not share personal information with any third-parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy: 

**Other Users You Share and Communicate with on ClassDojo**: No teacher, school leader, parent or student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service. Furthermore, students cannot share their account information or Student Story with anyone on ClassDojo, outside of their parents, teachers, or school leaders. If you are a teacher, school leader, or a parent, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other ClassDojo teachers, school leaders, students, or parents - for example, things like your account information, feedback points awarded to students you teach (if you are a teacher or school leader) or to your children (if you are a parent) or other information you share with teachers, school leaders, or parents you are communicating with through ClassDojo Messaging, Class Story, or School Story or our other collaboration features. 

Please keep in mind that information (including personal Information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other ClassDojo users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers and school leaders you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information and we are not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of such information or content by others.

**Third-party integrations on our Service**: When, as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you invite others via Facebook or Twitter, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing from ClassDojo. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.

**Service Providers**: Third-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to ClassDojo and personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties). We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - we can’t build everything ourselves, after all! We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. Additionally, we may also share information with social networking and other websites, applications or partners, for marketing and advertising our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students). Please see here for a list of the third-parties we work with to provide the Service. Generally, these service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Additionally, these service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Testimonials**: We post testimonials on our Service which may contain personal information such as the name, photo and/or a video of the individual in the testimonial. We obtain the individual’s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us at privacy@classdojo.com. 

**Analytics Services**: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. A current list of analytics providers that we use is located here.

**Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information**: We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how ClassDojo is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo. Any aggregated information shared this way will not contain any personal information.

**Legal Requirements**: We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our our Terms of Service or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.

**Sharing with ClassDojo Companies**: Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Change of control**: In the event that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party. This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.

In the unlikely event that ClassDojo goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third-party. For more information on our practices regarding your data if we go out of business, please see our FAQ.

**With your consent**: Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it. Additionally, as discussed above, we will never sell or rent your personal information to advertisers or other third-parties.

> Basically,
> 
> ClassDojo doesn’t sell or rent your personal information to any third-parties. We believe your information is yours, and you should own it - we think that’s the right way to operate. We share some  information with service providers who help us provide you with the ClassDojo service - like companies that help us send emails, for example, or if we have to to comply with the law.
> 
> And, if ClassDojo is ever acquired or goes out of business, our commitments don’t change: we still won’t sell or rent your personal information to anyone. Your personal information will continue to be protected by this policy, and any company that acquires ClassDojo will have to abide by this policy.

## How does ClassDojo protect and secure my information?

Your ClassDojo account is protected by a password or a QR code. You can help us protect against unauthorized access to your account by keeping your password or QR code secret at all times.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We work hard to protect our community, and we maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to personal information. In particular: 

* Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your personal information secure
* We work with a team of security researchers to continually test ClassDojo’s security practices for vulnerabilities
* We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems
* We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe - for example, when you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS) by default
* We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing
* The ClassDojo Service is hosted on servers at a third-party facility, with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures. For example, personal information is stored on a server equipped with industry standard firewalls. In addition, the hosting facility provides a 24x7 security system, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems and locked cage areas.
* We automatically delete inactive student accounts after a specific period of time, as per our retention policy, described in the “How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?” section

We also operate a ‘bug bounty’ security program to encourage an active community of third-party security researchers to report any security bugs to us. More information on this is available by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com.

Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can’t guarantee the security of information. Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.classdojo.com) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

> Basically,
> 
> The security of your information is important to us, and we take it very seriously. We’re always adding safeguards to ensure the safety and security of ClassDojo and our community of teachers, school leaders, parents, and students. You can help us out by keeping your password and QR code secret!

## ClassDojo’s commitments to providing Transparency and Choice

As you can see, we try to be transparent about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can: 

* Opt-out of providing certain information
* Access and manage your account information by using the account settings within ClassDojo
* Control who you share information with
* Delete your information from ClassDojo
* Take information out of ClassDojo

> Basically,
> 
> At ClassDojo, we believe that more transparency is better. We try to give you control, with easy settings and options, so that you can make good choices when it comes to your information and how it is used.

### Can I opt-out of providing information?
You can always decline to share personal information with us, or even block all cookies. However, it’s important to remember that many of ClassDojo’s features may not be accessible, or may not function properly - for example, we may not be able to remember your language preferences for you.

> Basically,
> 
> You can always opt-out of providing us information, though we might not be able to provide you with all of ClassDojo’s features.

### How can I access and manage my personal information?

ClassDojo aims to provide you with easy access to any personal information we have collected about you. If that information is incorrect, we give you easy ways to update it, or to delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business (e.g., we need at least an email address for your account) or legal purposes.

**Accessing Your Information**: Upon request, ClassDojo will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information, and, If you are a user of ClassDojo, you may request access to all your personal information we have on file by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. In some cases, we won’t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.


**Managing Your Information**: You may update, correct, or delete some of your profile information or your preferences at any time by logging into your account on ClassDojo and accessing your account settings page. You may have to verify your identity before you can do that. You may also, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

**Accessing Your Child’s Information**: Take a look at our “Parental Choices” section to see how you can obtain copies of your child’s personal information.

We may reject requests for access, change or deletion that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). 

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, even after you update or delete personal information you have provided us from our Service, your personal information may be retained in our backup files and archives for a reasonable period of time for legal purposes or for so long as is necessary in light of the purposes for which such records were collected or legitimately further processed.


> Basically,
> 
> You can always access and manage your personal information through your ClassDojo account, or by contacting us.

### How can I delete my account?

We hope you love using ClassDojo now and always. However, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account (or your child’s account, if you are his or her parent), you can do that at any time by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. If you are a parent, teacher, or school leader using the ClassDojo Website, you may also delete your account by logging into your account and accessing your account settings page.

When you delete your account, we delete your profile information and any other content you provide in your profile (such as your name, username, password, email address, and profile photos) and depending on the category of user you are (i.e., teacher, school leader, parent or student), feedback points and information collected through the mobile permissions you’ve granted. Information that you have shared with others, others have shared about you, or content other users may have copied and stored, is not part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. Additionally, please note, that even if your account is deleted, messages sent between teachers and parents are retained to assist schools with various recordkeeping or compliance obligations. This includes, for example, any content uploaded, including photos and videos on the Class Story or School Story, which we consider messaging between parents and teachers. For more details, please read “What happens when I delete my account?” in our FAQs.

> Basically,
> 
> You can always delete your account by visiting your account settings, or simply by contacting us. For more details on what happens when you delete your account, click here.

## How long does ClassDojo keep information about me?

We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above. Personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services, in which case we will delete prior to you deleting your account.

Please note that we may have to retain some information after your account is closed, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms. You can, of course, delete your account at any time, as per the “How can I delete my account?” section. Additionally, please note, that even if your account is deleted, messages sent between teachers and parents are retained to assist schools with various recordkeeping or compliance obligations. This includes, for example, any content uploaded, including photos and videos on the Class Story or School Story, which we consider messaging between parents and teachers. For more details, please read “What happens when I delete my account?” in our FAQs.


**3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy**: In addition to the policy above that applies to all users, we only keep a student’s personal information while the student’s account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, we have a 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy to protect students’ information: we collect minimal information from students to register for student accounts (or from their parent or teacher to create their account), delete feedback points automatically after 1 year if parents or students haven’t created associated accounts, and delete student accounts, including any student-uploaded content, if they are inactive for twelve months. Read more details about this incredibly student-friendly policy in the “How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?” section.

>  Basically,
>  
> We keep teacher, school leader, and parent personal information until your account is deleted, or until we no longer need it to provide you with the ClassDojo service. We only keep student personal information for as long as the student’s account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, or need it to protect the safety of our users. Additionally, for students, we have our 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy that states how we delete students’ information after some time - our business is not about creating permanent student records.

## What communications will I receive from ClassDojo?

If you registered on ClassDojo, provided an email or phone number to us, or otherwise opted-in to receive communications from us, we may send you messages and updates regarding your account, including privacy and security notices, updates regarding the Service, and information regarding products, features or services from ClassDojo (or third-parties we believe you may be interested in). These communications may include, but are not limited to, social media updates, SMS/MMS messages, push notifications, email, and postal mail. If you have an account with us, we’ll also use your email address to contact you for customer service purposes, or for any legal matters that arise in the course of business.

> 
> From time to time, we may send you useful messages about updates or new features. You can always opt-out of these messages if you’d rather we didn’t contact you.

## Social Media Features/Widgets
The Service may now or in the future include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and the Twitter Tweet button, or the ability to register on ClassDojo or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking service, such as through Facebook Connect or Google (collectively "Social Media Features"). These Social Media Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on our Service to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third-party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Additionally, if you decide to register on ClassDojo through a Social Media Feature, ClassDojo may also collect personal information that is already associated with your account connected to the Social Media Feature. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving ClassDojo the permission to use, share, and store it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Service. Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing each Social Media Feature. If you are not comfortable accessing such social media websites and using such Social Media Features, please don’t use them!

> Basically,
> 
> We may have some social media sharing features from Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networking sites available for use. These features are governed by the respective company's privacy policy.

## Third-party Services 
The Service may contain links to websites and services provided by third-parties (e.g. video players). Any personal information you provide on third-party websites or services is provided directly to that third-party and is subject to that third-party’s policies governing privacy and security. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these websites or services. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third-party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you, including if you view a video through an embedded video player which is played off our Service, but may appear to still be playing on our Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party websites or services. We encourage you to learn about third-parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with personal information.

> Basically,
> 
> Links to other websites and services as well as embedded video players may be found within the Service — this Privacy Policy does not apply to those.

## How will ClassDojo notify me of changes to this policy?
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy - you can see when the last update was by looking at the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We won’t reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. If we make any significant changes, we’ll provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service and/or notifying you by email (using the email address you provided), so you can review and make sure you know about them.

In addition, if we ever make significant changes to the types of personal information we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents in order to obtain parental consent or notice for those new practices. 

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Service. If you don’t agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account (although we’ll be sad to see you go!). By continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy.

> Basically,
> 
> We will let you know by email and/or on our website when we make significant changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make significant changes to the types of personal information we collect from children, or how we use it, we will notify parents, or ask for their consent.

## What if I’m not in the U.S.?
